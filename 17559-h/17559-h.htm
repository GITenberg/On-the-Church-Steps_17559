<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p>What a picture she was as she sat there, my own Bessie! and what a strange
place it was to rest on, those church steps! Behind us lay the Woolsey woods,
with their wooing fragrance of pine and soft rushes of scented air; and the
lakes were in the distance, lying very calm in the cloud-shadows and seeming to
wait for us to come. But to-day Bessie would nothing of lakes or ledges: she
would sit on the church steps.</p>
<p>In front of us, straight to the gate, ran a stiff little walk of white
pebbles, hard and harsh as some bygone creed.</p>
<p>"Think of little bare feet coming up here, Bessie!" I said with a shiver. "It
is too hard. And every carriage that comes up the hill sees us."</p>
<p>"And why shouldn't they see us?" said my lady, turning full upon me. "I am
not ashamed to be here."</p>
<p>"Churches should always have soft walks of turf; and lovers," I would fain
have added, "should have naught but whispering leaves about them."</p>
<p>But Bessie cut me short in her imperious way: "But we are not lovers this
morning: at least," with a half-relenting look at my rueful face, "we are very
good friends, and I choose to sit here to show people that we are."</p>
<p>"What do you care for <i>people</i>&mdash;the Bartons or the Meyricks?" as I
noticed a familiar family carriage toiling up the hill, followed by a lighter
phaeton. I recognized already in the latter vehicle the crimson feather of Fanny
Meyrick, and "the whip that was a parasol."</p>
<p>"Shall I step out into the road this minute, and stop those ladies like a
peaceable highwayman, and tell them you have promised to marry me, and that
their anxiety as to our intimacy may be at rest? Give me but leave and I will do
it. It will make Mrs. Barton comfortable. Then you and I can walk away into
those beckoning woods, and I can have you all to myself."</p>
<p>Indeed she was worth having. With the witchery that some girls know, she had
made a very picture of herself that morning, as I have said. Some soft blue
muslin stuff was caught up around her in airy draperies&mdash;nothing stiff or frilled
about her: all was soft and flowing, from the falling sleeve that showed the
fair curve of her arm to the fold of her dress, the ruffle under which her
little foot was tapping, impatiently now. A little white hat with a curling blue
feather shaded her face&mdash;a face I won't trust myself to describe, save by saying
that it was the brightest and truest, as I then thought, in all the world.</p>
<p>She said something rapidly in Italian&mdash;she is always artificial when she uses
a foreign tongue&mdash;and this I caught but imperfectly, but it had a proverbial air
about it of the error of too hasty assumptions.</p>
<p>"Well, now I'll tell you something," she said as the carriages disappeared
over the top of the hill. "Fanny Meyrick is going abroad in October, and we
shall not see her for ever so long."</p>
<p>Going abroad? Good gracious! That was the very thing I had to tell her that
morning&mdash;that I too was ordered abroad. An estate to be settled&mdash;some bothering
old claim that had been handed down from generation to generation, and now
springing into life again by the lapsing of two lives on the other side. But how
to tell her as she looked up into my face with the half-pleading, half-imperious
smile that I knew so well? How to tell her <i>now</i>?</p>
<p>So I said nothing, but foolishly pushed the little pebbles aside with my
stick, fatuously waiting for the subject to pass. Of course my silence brought
an instant criticism: "Why, Charlie, what ails you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. And really, Bessie, what is it
to us whether Fanny Meyrick go or stay?"</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have thought it <i>was</i> anything. But your silence, your
confusion&mdash;Charlie, you do care a little for her, after all."</p>
<p>Two years ago, before Bessie and I had ever met, I had fluttered around Fanny
Meyrick for a season, attracted by her bright brown eyes and the gypsy flush on
her cheek. But there were other moths fluttering around that adamantine candle
too; and I was not long in discovering that the brown eyes were bright for each
and all, and that the gypsy flush was never stirred by feeling or by thought. It
was merely a fixed ensign of health and good spirits. Consequently the charm had
waned, for me at least; and in my confessions to Bessie since our near intimacy
it was she, not I, who had magnified it into the shadow even of a serious
thought.</p>
<p>"Care for her? Nonsense, Bessie! Do you want me to call her a mere doll, a
hard, waxen&mdash;no, for wax will melt&mdash;a Parian creature, such as you may see by the
dozens in Schwartz's window any day? It doesn't gratify you, surely, to hear me
say that of any woman."</p>
<p>And then&mdash;what possessed me?&mdash;I was so angry at myself that I took a mental
<i>résumé</i> of all the good that could be said of Fanny Meyrick&mdash;her
generosity, her constant cheerfulness; and in somewhat headlong fashion I
expressed myself: "I won't call her a dolt and an idiot, even to please you. I
have seen her do generous things, and she is never out of temper."</p>
<p>"Thanks!" said Bessie, nodding her head till the blue feather trembled. "It
is as well, as Aunt Sloman says, to keep my shortcomings before you."</p>
<p>"When did Aunt Sloman say that?" I interrupted, hoping for a diversion of the
subject.</p>
<p>"This morning only. I was late at breakfast. You know, Charlie, I was
<i>so</i> tired with that long horseback ride, and of course everything waited.
Dear aunty never <i>will</i> begin until I come down, but sits beside the urn
like the forlornest of martyrs, and reads last night's papers over and over
again."</p>
<p>"Well? And was she sorry that she had not invited me to wait with her?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Bessie. "She said all sorts of things, and," flushing slightly,
"that it was a pity you shouldn't know beforehand what you were to expect."</p>
<p>"I wish devoutly that I had been there," seizing the little hand that was
mournfully tapping the weatherbeaten stone, and forcing the downcast eyes to
look at me. "I think, both together, we could have pacified Aunt Sloman."</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> a diversion, and after a little while Bessie professed she had
had enough of the church steps.</p>
<p>"How those people do stare! Is it the W&mdash;&mdash;s, do you think, Charlie? I heard
yesterday they were coming."</p>
<p>From our lofty position on the hillside we commanded the road leading out of
the village&mdash;the road that was all alive with carriages on this beautiful
September morning. The W&mdash;&mdash; carriage had half halted to reconnoitre, and had only
not hailed us because we had sedulously looked another way.</p>
<p>"Let's get away," I said, "for the next carriage will not only stop, but come
over;" and Bessie suffered herself to be led through the little tangle of brier
and fern, past the gray old gravestones with "Miss Faith" and "Miss Mehitable"
carved upon them, and into the leafy shadow of the waiting woods.</p>
<p>Other lovers have been there before us, but the trees whisper no secrets save
their own. The subject of our previous discussion was not resumed, nor was Fanny
Meyrick mentioned, until on our homeward road we paused a moment on the hilltop,
as we always did.</p>
<p>It is indeed a hill of vision, that church hill at Lenox. Sparkling far to
the south, the blue Dome lay, softened and shining in the September sun. There
was ineffable peace in the faint blue sky, and, stealing up from the valley, a
shimmering haze that seemed to veil the bustling village and soften all the
rural sounds.</p>
<p>Bessie drew nearer to me, shading her eyes as she looked down into the
valley: "Charlie dear, let us stay here always. We shall be happier, better here
than to go back to New York."</p>
<p>"And the law-business?" I asked like a brutal bear, bringing the realities of
life into my darling's girlish dream.</p>
<p>"Can't you practice law in Foxcroft, and drive over there every morning?
People do."</p>
<p>"And because they do, and there are enough of them, I must plod along in the
ways that are made for me already. We can make pilgrimages here, you know."</p>
<p>"I suppose so," said Bessie with a sigh.</p>
<p>Just then Fanny Kemble's clock in the tower above us struck the hour&mdash;one,
two, three.</p>
<p>"Bless me! so late? And there's that phaeton coming back over the hill again.
Hurry, Charlie! don't let them see us. They'll think that we've been here all
the time." And Bessie plunged madly down the hill, and struck off into the
side-path that leads into the Lebanon road. The last vibrations of the bell were
still trembling on the air as I caught up with her again.</p>
<p>But again the teasing mood of the morning had come over her. Quite out of
breath with the run, as we sat down to rest on the little porch of Mrs. Sloman's
cottage she said, very earnestly, "But you haven't once said it."</p>
<p>"Said what, my darling?"</p>
<p>"That you are glad that Fanny is going abroad."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Why should I be glad?"</p>
<p>"Are you sorry, then?"</p>
<p>If I had but followed my impulse then, and said frankly that I was, and why I
was! But Mrs. Sloman was coming through the little hall: I heard her step. Small
time for explanation, no time for reproaches. And I could not leave Bessie, on
that morning of all others, hurt or angry, or only half convinced.</p>
<p>"No, I am not sorry," I said, pulling down a branch of honeysuckle, and
making a loop of it to draw around her neck. "It is nothing, either way."</p>
<p>"Then say after me if it is nothing&mdash;feel as I feel for one minute, won't
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>
<p>"Say, after me, then, word for word, 'I am glad, <i>very</i> glad, that Fanny
Meyrick is to sail in October. I would not have her stay on this side for
<i>worlds</i>!"</p>
<p>And like a fool, a baby, I said it, word for word, from those sweet smiling
lips: "I am glad, <i>very</i> glad, that Fanny Meyrick is to sail in October. I
would not have her stay on this side for <i>worlds</i>!"</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and I was on duty at an early hour, prepared to walk
with Bessie to church. My darling was peculiar among women in this: her
church-going dress was sober-suited; like a little gray nun, almost, she came
down to me that morning. Her dress, of some soft gray stuff, fell around her in
the simplest folds, a knot of brown ribbon at her throat, and in her hat a gray
gull's wing.</p>
<p>I had praised the Italian women for the simplicity of their church-attire:
their black dresses and lace veils make a picturesque contrast with the gorgeous
ceremonials of the high altar. But there was something in this quiet toilet, so
fresh and simple and girl-like, that struck me as the one touch of grace that
the American woman can give to the best even of foreign taste. Not the dramatic
abnegation indicated by the black dress, but the quiet harmony of a life
atune.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sloman was ready even before Bessie came down. She was a great invalid,
although her prim and rigid countenance forbore any expression save of severity.
She had no pathos about her, not a touch. Whatever her bodily sufferings may
have been&mdash;and Bessie dimly hinted that they were severe to agony at times&mdash;they
were resolutely shut within her chamber door; and when she came out in the early
morning, her cold brown hair drawn smoothly over those impassive cheeks, she
looked like a lady abbess&mdash;as cold, as unyielding and as hard.</p>
<p>There was small sympathy between the aunt and niece, but a great deal of
painstaking duty on the one side, and on the
other the habit of affection which young girls have for the faces they have
always known.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sloman had been at pains to tell me, when my frequent visits to her
cottage made it necessary that I should in some fashion explain to her as to
what I wanted there, that her niece, Bessie Stewart, was in nowise dependent on
her, not even for a home. "This cottage we rent in common. It was her father's
desire that her property should not accumulate, and that she should have nothing
at my hands but companionship, and"&mdash;with a set and sickly smile&mdash;"advice when it
was called for. We are partners in our expenses, and the arrangement can be
broken up at any moment."</p>
<p>Was this all? No word of love or praise for the fair young thing that had
brightened all her household in these two years that Bessie had been
fatherless?</p>
<p>I believe there was love and appreciation, but it was not Mrs. Sloman's
method to be demonstrative or expansive. She approved of the engagement, and in
her grim way had opened an immediate battery of household ledgers and ways and
means. Some idea, too, of making me feel easy about taking Bessie away from her,
I think, inclined her to this business-like manner. I tried to show her, by my
own manner, that I understood her without words, and I think she was very
grateful to be spared the expression of feeling. Poor soul! repression had
become such a necessity to her!</p>
<p>So we talked on gravely of the weather, and of the celebrated Doctor McQ&mdash;&mdash;,
who was expected to give us an argumentative sermon that morning, until
<i>my</i> argument came floating in at the door like a calm little bit of
thistledown, to which our previous conversation had been as the thistle's
self.</p>
<p>The plain little church was gay that morning. Carriage after carriage drove
up with much prancing and champing, and group after group of city folk came
rustling along the aisles. It was a bit of Fifth Avenue let into Lenox calm. The
World and the Flesh were there, at least.</p>
<p>In the hush of expectancy that preceded the minister's arrival there was much
waving of scented fans, while the well-bred city glances took in everything
without seeming to see. I felt that Bessie and I were being mentally discussed
and ticketed. And as it was our first appearance at church since&mdash;well,
<i>since</i>&mdash;perhaps there was just a little consciousness of our relations that
made Bessie seem to retire absolutely within herself, and be no more a part of
the silken crowd than was the grave, plain man who rose up in the pulpit.</p>
<p>I hope the sermon was satisfactory. I am sure it was convincing to a
brown-handed farmer who sat beside us, and who could with difficulty restrain
his applauding comment. But I was lost in a dream of a near heaven, and could
not follow the spoken word. It was just a quiet little opportunity to
contemplate my darling, to tell over her sweetness and her charm, and to say
over and again, like a blundering school-boy, "It's all mine! mine!"</p>
<p>The congregation might have been dismissed for aught I knew, and left me
sitting there with her beside me. But I was startled into the proprieties as we
stood up to sing the concluding hymn. I was standing stock-still beside her, not
listening to the words at all, but with a pleasant sense of everything being
very comfortable, and an old-fashioned swell of harmony on the air, when
suddenly the book dropped from Bessie's hand and fell heavily to the floor. I
should have said she flung it down had it been on any other occasion, so rapid
and vehement was the action.</p>
<p>I stooped to pick it up, when with a decided gesture she stopped me. I looked
at her surprised. Her face was flushed, indignant, I thought, and instantly my
conscience was on the rack. What had I done, for my lady was evidently
angry?</p>
<p>Glancing down once more toward the book, I saw that she had set her foot upon
it, and indeed her whole attitude was one of excitement, defiance. Why did she
look so hot and scornful? I was disturbed and anxious: what was there in the
book or in me to anger her?</p>
<p>As quickly as possible I drew her away from the bustling crowd when the
service was concluded. Fortunately, there was a side-door through which we could
pass out into the quiet churchyard, and we vanished through it, leaving Mrs.
Sloman far behind. Over into the Lebanon road was but a step, and the little
porch was waiting with its cool honeysuckle shade. But Bessie did not stop at
the gate: she was in no mood for home. And yet she would not answer my
outpouring questions as to whether she was ill, or what <i>was</i> the
matter.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you in a minute. Come, hurry!" she said, hastening along up the
hill through all the dust and heat.</p>
<p>At last we reached that rustic bit of ruin known popularly as the "Shed." It
was a hard bit of climbing, but I rejoiced that Bessie, so flushed and excited
at the start, grew calmer as we went; and when, the summit reached, she sat down
to rest on a broken board, her color was natural and she seemed to breathe
freely again.</p>
<p>"Are they all hypocrites, do you think, Charlie?" she said suddenly, looking
up into my face.</p>
<p>"They? who? Bessie, what have I done to make you angry?"</p>
<p>"You? Nothing, dear goose! I am angry at myself and at everybody else. Did it
flash upon you, Charlie, what we were singing?"</p>
<p>Then she quoted the lines, which I will not repeat here, but they expressed,
as the sole aspiration of the singer, a desire to pass eternity in singing hymns
of joy and praise&mdash;an impatience for the time to come, a disregard of earth, a
turning away from temporal things, and again the desire for an eternity of
sacred song.</p>
<p>"Suppose I confess to you," said I, astonished at her earnestness, "that I
did not at all know what I was singing?"</p>
<p>"That's just it! just what makes it so dreadful! <i>Nobody</i> was thinking
about it&mdash;nobody! Nobody there wanted to give up earth and go straight to heaven
and sing. I looked round at all the people,
with their new bonnets, and the diamonds, and the footmen in the pews up stairs,
and I thought, What lies they are all saying! Nobody wants to go to heaven at
all until they are a hundred years old, and too deaf and blind and tired out to
do anything on earth. My heaven is here and now in my own happiness, and so is
yours, Charlie; and I felt so convicted of being a story-teller that I couldn't
hold the book in my hand."</p>
<p>"Well, then," said I, "shall we have one set of hymns for happy people, and
another for poor, tired-out folks like that little dressmaker that leaned
against the wall?" For Bessie herself had called my attention to the pale little
body who had come to the church door at the same moment with us.</p>
<p>"No, not two sets. Do you suppose that she, either, wants to <i>sing</i> on
for ever? And all those girls! Sorry enough they would be to have to die, and
leave their dancing and flirtations and the establishments they hope to have! It
wouldn't be much comfort to them to promise them they should <i>sing</i>.
Charlie, I want a hymn that shall give thanks that I am alive, that I have
<i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"Could the dressmaker sing that?"</p>
<p>"No;" and Bessie's eyes sought the shining blue sky with a wistful,
beseeching tenderness. "Oh, it's all wrong, Charlie dear. She ought to tell us
in a chant how tired and hopeless she is for this world; and we ought to sing to
her something that would cheer her, help her, even in this world. Why must she
wait for all her brightness till she dies? So perfectly heartless to stand up
along side of her and sing <i>that</i>!"</p>
<p>"Well," I said, "you needn't wait till next Sunday to bring her your words of
cheer."</p>
<p>In a minute my darling was crying on my shoulder. I could understand the
outburst, and was glad of it.</p>
<p>All athrill with new emotions, new purposes, an eternity of love, she had
come to church to be reminded that earth was naught, that the trials and
tempests here would come to an end some day, and after, to the patiently
victorious, would come the hymns of praise.
<i>Earth</i> was very full that morning to her and me; <i>earth</i> was a place
for worshipful harmonies; and yet the strong contrast with the poor patient
sufferer who had passed into church with us was too much for Bessie: she craved
an expression that should comprehend alike her sorrow and our abundant joy.</p>
<p>The tempest of tears passed by, and we had bright skies again. Poor Mrs.
Sloman's dinner waited long that day; and it was with a guilty sense that she
was waiting too that we went down the hill at a quickened pace when the church
clock, sounding up the hillside, came like a chiding voice.</p>
<p>And a double sense of guiltiness was creeping over me. I must return to New
York to-morrow, and I had not told Bessie yet of the longer journey I must make
so soon. I put it by again and again in the short flying hours of that
afternoon; and it was not until dusk had fallen in the little porch, as we sat
there after tea, and I had watched the light from Mrs. Sloman's chamber shine
down upon the honeysuckles and then go out, that I took my resolution.</p>
<p>"Bessie," I said, leaning over her and taking her face in both my hands, "I
have something to tell you."</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p>"I have something to tell you;" and without an instant's pause I went on:
"Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; has business in England which cannot be attended to by letter. One of
us must go, and they send me. I must sail in two weeks."</p>
<p>It was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky, and Bessie gave a little gasp of
surprise: "So soon! Oh, Charlie, take me with you!" Realizing in the next
instant the purport of the suggestion, she flung away from my hands and rushed
into the parlor, where a dim, soft lamp was burning on the table. She sat down
on a low chair beside it and hid her face on the table in her hands.</p>
<p>Like a flash of lightning all the possibilities of our marriage before many
days&mdash;arranging it with Mrs. Sloman, and satisfying my partners, who would expect
me to travel fast and work hard in the short time they had allotted for the
journey,&mdash;all came surging and throbbing through my brain, while my first answer
was not given in words.</p>
<p>When I had persuaded Bessie to look at me and to answer me in turn, I hoped
we should be able to talk about it with the calm judgment it needed.</p>
<p>"To leave my wife&mdash;my wife!"&mdash;how I lingered on the word!&mdash;"in some poky
lodgings in London, while I am spending my day among dusty boxes and files of
deeds in a dark old office, isn't just my ideal of our wedding-journey; but,
Bessie, if <i>you</i> wish it so&mdash;"</p>
<p>What was there in my tone that jarred her? I had meant to be magnanimous, to
think of her comfort alone, of the hurry and business of such a journey&mdash;tried to
shut myself out and think only of her in the picture. But I failed, of course,
and went on stupidly, answering the quick look of question in her eyes: "If you
prefer it&mdash;that is, you know, I must think of you and not of myself."</p>
<p>Still the keen questioning glance. What new look was this in her eyes, what
dawning thought?</p>
<p>"No," she answered after a pause, slowly withdrawing her hand from mine,
"think of yourself."</p>
<p>I had expected that she would overwhelm me in her girlish way with saucy
protestations that she would be happy even in the dull London lodgings, and that
she would defy the law-files to keep me long from her. This sudden change of
manner chilled me with a nameless fear.</p>
<p>"If <i>I</i> prefer it! If <i>I</i> wish it! I see that I should be quite in
your way, an encumbrance. Don't talk about it any more."</p>
<p>She was very near crying, and I wish to heaven she had cried. But she
conquered herself resolutely, and held herself cold and musing before me. I
might take her hand, might kiss her unresisting cheek, but she seemed frozen
into sudden thoughtfulness that it was impossible to meet or to dispel.</p>
<p>"Bessie, you know you are a little goose! What could I wish for in life but
to carry you off this minute to New York? Come, get your hat and let's walk over
to the parsonage now. We'll get Doctor Wilder to marry us, and astonish your
aunt in the morning."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Bessie with a slight quiver of her pretty, pouting mouth.
"Do be rational, Charlie!"</p>
<p>I believe I was rational in my own fashion for a little while, but when I
ventured to say in a very unnecessary whisper, "Then you will go abroad with
me?" Bessie flushed to her temples and rose from the sofa. She had a way, when
she was very much in earnest, or very much stirred with some passionate thought,
of pacing the parlor with her hands clasped tightly before her, and her arms
tense and straining at the clasping hands. With her head bent slightly forward,
and her brown hair hanging in one long tress over her shoulder, she went swiftly
up and down, while I lay back on the sofa and watched her. She would speak it
out presently, the thought that was hurting her. So I felt secure and waited,
following every movement with a lover's eye. But I ought not to have waited. I
should have drawn her to me and shared that rapid, nervous walk&mdash;should have
compelled her with sweet force to render an account of that emotion. But I was
so secure, so entirely one with her in thought, that I could conceive of nothing
but a passing tempest at my blundering, stupid thoughtfulness for her.</p>
<p>Suddenly at the door she stopped, and with her hand upon it said,
"Good-night, Charlie;" and was out of the room in a twinkling.</p>
<p>I sprang from the sofa and to the foot of the stairs, but I saw only a
glimpse of her vanishing dress; and though I called after her in low, beseeching
tones, "Bessie! Bessie!" a door shut in the distant corridor for only
answer.</p>
<p>What to do? In that decorous mansion I could not follow her; and my impulse
to dash after her and knock at her door till she answered me, I was forced to
put aside after a moment's consideration.</p>
<p>I stood there in the quiet hall, the old clock ticking away a solemn
"I-told-you-so!" in the corner. I made one step toward the kitchen to send a
message by one of the maids, but recoiled at the suggestion that this would
publish a lovers' quarrel. So I retreated along the hall, my footsteps making no
noise on the India matting, and entered the parlor again like a thief. I sat
down by the table: "Bessie will certainly come back: she will get over her
little petulance, and know I am here waiting."</p>
<p>All about the parlor were the traces of my darling. A soft little coil of
rose-colored Berlin wool, with its ivory needle sheathed among the stitches, lay
in a tiny basket. I lifted it up: the basket was made of scented grass, and
there was a delicious sweet and pure fragrance about the knitting-work. I took
possession of it and thrust it into my breast-pocket. A magazine she had been
reading, with the palest slip of a paper-knife&mdash;a bit of delicate Swiss wood&mdash;in
it, next came in my way. I tried to settle down and read where she had left off,
but the words danced before my eyes, and a strange tune was repeating in my
ears, "Good-night, Charlie&mdash;good-night and good-bye!"</p>
<p>One mad impulse seized me to go out under her window and call to her, asking
her to come down. But Lenox nights were very still, and the near neighbors on
either side doubtless wide awake to all that was going on around the Sloman
cottage.</p>
<p>So I sat still like an idiot, and counted the clock-strokes, and nervously
calculated the possibility of her reappearance, until I heard, at last,
footsteps coming along the hall in rapid tread. I darted up: "Oh, Bessie, I knew
you would come back!" as through the open door walked in&mdash;Mary, Mrs. Sloman's
maid!</p>
<p>She started at seeing me: "Excuse me, sir. The parlor was so&mdash;I thought there
was no one here."</p>
<p>"What is it, Mary?" I asked with assumed indifference. "Do you want Miss
Bessie? She went up stairs a few moments ago."</p>
<p>"No, sir. I thought&mdash;that is&mdash;" glancing
down in awkward confusion at the key she held in her hand. She was retiring
again softly when I saw in the key the reason of her discomposure.</p>
<p>"Did you come in to lock up, Mary?" I asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. But it is of no consequence. I thought you had gone, sir."</p>
<p>"Time I was, I suppose. Well, Mary, you shall lock me out, and then carry
this note to Miss Bessie. It is so late that I will not wait for her. Perhaps
she is busy with Mrs. Sloman."</p>
<p>Something in Mary's face made me suspect that she knew Mrs. Sloman to be
sound asleep at this moment; but she said nothing, and waited respectfully until
I had scribbled a hasty note, rifling Bessie's writing-desk for the envelope in
which to put my card. Dear child! there lay my photograph, the first thing I saw
as I raised the dainty lid.</p>
<p>"Bessie," I wrote, "I have waited until Mary has come in with her keys, and I
suppose I must go. My train starts at nine to-morrow morning, but you will be
ready&mdash;will you not?&mdash;at six to take a morning walk with me. I will be here at
that hour. You don't know how disturbed and anxious I shall be till then."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p>Morning came&mdash;or rather the long night came to an end at last&mdash;and at twenty
minutes before six I opened the gate at the Sloman cottage. It was so late in
September that the morning was a little hazy and uncertain. And yet the air was
warm and soft&mdash;a perfect reflex, I thought, of Bessie last night&mdash;an electric
softness under a brooding cloud.</p>
<p>The little house lay wrapped in slumber. I hesitated to pull the bell: no, it
would startle Mrs. Sloman. Bessie was coming: she would surely not make me wait.
Was not that her muslin curtain stirring? I would wait in the porch&mdash;she would
certainly come down soon.</p>
<p>So I waited, whistling softly to myself as I pushed the withered leaves about
with my stick and drew strange patterns among them. Half an hour passed.</p>
<p>"I will give her a gentle reminder;" so I gathered a spray from the
honeysuckle, a late bloom among the fast-falling leaves, and aimed it right at
the muslin curtain. The folds parted and it fell into the room, but instead of
the answering face that I looked to see, all was still again.</p>
<p>"It's very strange," thought I. "Bessie's pique is not apt to last so long.
She must indeed be angry."</p>
<p>And I went over each detail of our last night's talk, from her first burst of
"Take me with you!" to my boggling answers, my fears, so stupidly expressed,
that it would be anything but a picturesque bridal-trip, and the necessity that
there was for rapid traveling and much musty, old research.</p>
<p>"What a fool I was not to take her then and there! She <i>is</i> myself: why
shouldn't I, then, be selfish? When I do what of all things I want to, why can't
I take it for granted that she will be happy too?" And a hot flush of shame went
over me to think that I had been about to propose to her, to my own darling
girl, that we should be married as soon as possible <i>after</i> I returned from
Europe.</p>
<p>Her love, clearer-sighted, had striven to forestall our separation: why
should we be parted all those weary weeks? why put the sea between us?</p>
<p>I had accepted all these obstacles as a dreary necessity, never thinking for
the moment that conventional objections might be overcome, aunts and guardians
talked over, and the whole matter arranged by two people determined on their own
sweet will.</p>
<p>What a lumbering, masculine plan was mine! <i>After I returned from
Europe!</i> I grew red and bit my lips with vexation. And now my dear girl was
shy and hurt. How should I win back again that sweet impulse of confidence?</p>
<p>Presently the household began to stir. I heard unbarring and unbolting, and
craftily retreated to the gate, that I might seem to be just coming in, to the
servant who should open the door.</p>
<p>It was opened by a housemaid&mdash;not the Mary of the night before&mdash;who stared a
moment at seeing me, but on my asking if Miss Bessie was ready yet to walk,
promised smilingly to go and see. She returned in a moment, saying that Miss
Bessie begged that I would wait: she was hurrying to come down.</p>
<p>The child! She has slept too soundly. I shall tell her how insensate she must
have been, how serenely unconscious when the flower came in at the window.</p>
<p>The clock on the mantel struck seven and the half hour before Bessie
appeared. She was very pale, and her eyes looked away at my greeting. Passively
she suffered herself to be placed in a chair, and then, with something of her
own manner, she said hurriedly, "Don't think I got your note, Charlie, last
night, or I wouldn't, indeed I wouldn't, have kept you waiting so long this
morning."</p>
<p>"Didn't Mary bring it to you?" I asked, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes: that is, she brought it up to my room, but, Charlie dear, I wasn't
there: I wasn't there all night. I did shut my door, though I heard you calling,
and after a little while I crept out into the entry and looked over the stairs,
hoping you were there still, and that I could come back to you. But you were not
there, and everything was so still that I was sure you had gone&mdash;gone without a
word. I listened and listened, but I was too proud to go down into the parlor
and see. And yet I could not go back to my room, next Aunt Sloman's. I went
right up stairs to the blue room, and stayed there. Mary must have put your note
on my table when she came up stairs. I found it there this morning when I went
down."</p>
<p>"Poor darling! And what did you do all night in the blue room? I am afraid,"
looking at her downcast eyes, "that you did not sleep&mdash;that you were angry at
me."</p>
<p>"At you? No, at myself," she said very low.</p>
<p>"Bessie, you know that my first and only thought was of the hurry and worry
this journey would cost you. You know that
to have you with me was something that I had scarce dared to dream."</p>
<p>"And therefore," with a flash of blue eyes, "for me to dare to dream it was&mdash;"
and again she hid her face.</p>
<p>"But, my precious, don't you know that it was for <i>you</i> to suggest what
I wanted all the time, but thought it would be too much to ask?" For I had
discovered, of course, in my morning's work among the dead leaves on the porch,
that I had desired it from the moment I had known of my journey&mdash;desired it
without acknowledging it to myself or presuming to plan upon it.</p>
<p>At this juncture breakfast was announced, and the folding doors thrown open
that led into the breakfast-parlor, disclosing Mrs. Sloman seated by the silver
urn, and a neat little table spread for three, so quick had been the housemaid's
intuitions.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, Charles: come get some breakfast. You will hardly be in time
for your train," suggested Aunt Sloman in a voice that had in it all the gloom
of the morning. Indeed, the clouds had gathered heavily during the parlor scene,
and some large drops were rattling against the window.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch. After eight! Pshaw! I will let this train go, and will
telegraph to the office. I can take the night train, and thus lose only a few
hours. So I stayed.</p>
<p>What rare power had Bessie in the very depths of her trouble, and with her
face pale and eyes so heavy with her last night's vigil&mdash;what gift that helped
her to be gay? Apparently not with an effort, not forced, she was as joyous and
frank as her sunniest self. No exaggeration of laughter or fun, but the
brightness of her every-day manner, teasing and sparkling round Aunt Sloman,
coquetting very naturally with me. It was a swift change from the gloomy
atmosphere we had left behind in the parlor, and I basked in it delighted, and
feeling, poor fool! that the storm was cleared away, and that the time for the
singing of birds was come.</p>
<p>I was the more deceived. I did not know all of Bessie yet. Her horror of a
scene, of any suspicion that there was
discord between us, and her rare self-control, that for the moment put aside all
trouble, folded it out of sight and took up the serene old life again for a
little space.</p>
<p>"Aunt Maria," said Bessie, pushing aside her chair, "won't you take care of
Mr. Munro for a little while? I have a letter to write that I want him to take
to New York."</p>
<p>Aunt Maria would be happy to entertain me, or rather to have me entertain
her. If I would read to her, now, would I be so kind, while she washed up her
breakfast cups?</p>
<p>How people can do two things at once I am sure I cannot understand; and while
the maid brought in the large wooden bowl, the steam of whose household incense
rose high in the air, I watched impatient for the signal to begin. When the
tea-cups were all collected, and Aunt Sloman held one by the handle daintily
over the "boiling flood," "Now," she said with a serene inclination of her head,
"if you please."</p>
<p>And off I started at a foot-pace through the magazine that had been put into
my hands. Whether it was anything about the "Skelligs," or "Miss Sedgwick's
Letters," or "Stanley-Livingstone," I have not the remotest idea. I was
fascinated by the gentle dip of each tea-cup, and watched from the corner of my
eye the process of polishing each glittering spoon on a comfortable crash
towel.</p>
<p>Then my thoughts darted off to Bessie. Was she indeed writing to her old
trustee? Judge Hubbard was a friend of my father's, and would approve of me, I
thought, if he did not agree at once to the hurried marriage and ocean
journey.</p>
<p>"What an unconscionable time it takes her! Don't you think so, Mrs. Sloman?"
I said at last, after I had gone through three several papers on subjects
unknown.</p>
<p>I suppose it was scarcely a courteous speech. But Mrs. Sloman smiled a
white-lipped smile of sympathy, and said, "Yes: I will go and send her to
you."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't hurry her," I said falsely, hoping, however, that she would.</p>
<p>Did I say before that Bessie was tall? Though so slight that you always
wanted to speak of her with some endearing diminutive, she looked taller than
ever that morning; and as she stood before me, coming up to the fireplace where
I was standing, her eyes looked nearly level into mine. I did not understand
their veiled expression, and before I had time to study it she dropped them and
said hastily, "Young man, I am pining for a walk."</p>
<p>"In the rain?"</p>
<p>"Pshaw! This is nothing, after all, but a Scotch mist. See, I am dressed for
it;" and she threw a tartan cloak over her shoulder&mdash;a blue-and-green tartan that
I had never seen before.</p>
<p>"The very thing for shipboard," I whispered as I looked at her
admiringly.</p>
<p>Her face was flushed enough now, but she made no answer save to stoop down
and pat the silly little terrier that had come trotting into the room with
her.</p>
<p>"Fidget shall go&mdash;yes, he shall go walking;" and Fidget made a gray ball of
himself in his joy at the permission.</p>
<p>Up the hill again we walked, with the little Skye terrier cantering in
advance or madly chasing the chickens across the road.</p>
<p>"Did you finish your letter satisfactorily?" I asked, for I was fretting with
impatience to know its contents.</p>
<p>"Yes. I will give it to you when you leave to-night."</p>
<p>"Shall we say next Saturday, Bessie?" said I, resolving to plunge at once
into the sea of our late argument.</p>
<p>"For what? For you to come again? Don't you always come on Saturday?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but this time I mean to carry you away."</p>
<p>A dead pause, which I improved by drawing her hand under my arm and
imprisoning her little gray glove with my other hand. As she did not speak, I
went on fatuously: "You don't need any preparation of gowns and shawls; you can
buy your <i>trousseau</i> in London, if need be; and we'll settle on the ship,
coming over, how and where we are to live in New York."</p>
<p>"You think, then, that I am all ready to be married?"</p>
<p>"I think that my darling is superior to the nonsense of other girls&mdash;that she
will be herself always, and doesn't need any masquerade of wedding finery."</p>
<p>"You think, then," coldly and drawing her hand away, "that I am different
from other girls?" and the scarlet deepened on her cheek. "You think I say and
do things other girls would not?"</p>
<p>"My darling, what nonsense! You say and do things that other girls
<i>cannot</i>, nor could if they tried a thousand years."</p>
<p>"Thanks for the compliment! It has at least the merit of dubiousness. Now,
Charlie, if you mention Europe once in this walk I shall be seriously offended.
Do let us have a little peace and a quiet talk."</p>
<p>"Why, what on earth can we talk about until this is settled? I can't go back
to New York, and engage our passage, and go to see Judge Hubbard&mdash;I suppose you
were writing to him this morning?"</p>
<p>She did not answer, but seemed bent on making the dainty print of her foot in
the moist earth of the road, taking each step carefully, as though it were the
one important and engrossing thing in life.</p>
<p>"&mdash;Unless," I went on, "you tell me you will be ready to go back with me this
day week. You see, Bessie dear, I <i>must</i> sail on the fixed day. And if we
talk it over now and settle it all, it will save no end of writing to and
fro."</p>
<p>"Good-morning!" said a gay voice behind us&mdash;Fanny Meyrick's voice. She was
just coming out of one of the small houses on the roadside. "Don't you want some
company? I've been to call on my washerwoman, and I'm so glad I've met you. Such
an English morning! Shall I walk with you?"</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>If I could have changed places with Fidget, I could scarce have expressed
my disapproval of the new-comer more
vehemently than he. Miss Meyrick seemed quite annoyed at the little dog's
uncalled-for snapping and barking, and shook her umbrella at him in vain. I was
obliged to take him in hand myself at last, and to stand in the road and order
him to "Go home!" while the two young ladies walked on, apparently the best of
friends.</p>
<p>When I rejoined them Fanny Meyrick was talking fast and unconnectedly, as was
her habit: "Yes, lodgings in London&mdash;the dearest old house in Clarges street.
Such a butler! He looks like a member of Parliament. We stayed there once before
for three days. I am just going to settle into an English girl. Had enough of
the Continent. Never do see England now-a-days, nobody. All rush off. So papa is
going to have a comfortable time. Embassy? Oh, I know the general well."</p>
<p>I looked beseechingly at Bessie. Why wouldn't she say that we too would be
there in London lodgings? Perhaps, then, Fanny Meyrick might take the hint and
leave us soon.</p>
<p>But Bessie gave no sign, and I relapsed into a somewhat impatient
<i>résumé</i> of my own affairs. Yes: married quietly on Saturday; leave here on
Monday morning train; take, yes, Wednesday's steamer. I could arrange it with my
law-partners to be absent a little longer perhaps, that there might be some
little rest and romance about the wedding-journey.</p>
<p>Two or three times in the course of that morning&mdash;for she stayed with us all
the morning&mdash;Fanny Meyrick rallied me on my preoccupation and silence: "He didn't
use to be so, Bessie, years ago, I assure you. It's very disagreeable, sir&mdash;not
an improvement by any means."</p>
<p>Then&mdash;I think without any malice prepense, simply the unreasoning rattle of a
belle of two seasons&mdash;she plunged into a description of a certain fête at
Blankkill on the Hudson, the occasion of our first acquaintance: "He was so
young, Bessie, you can't imagine, and blushed so beautifully that all the girls
were jealous as could be. We were very good
friends&mdash;weren't we?&mdash;all that summer?"</p>
<p>"And are still, I hope," said I with my most sweeping bow. "What have I done
to forfeit Miss Meyrick's esteem?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, except that you used to find your way oftener to Meyrick Place than
you do now. Well, I won't scold you for that: I shall make up for that on the
other side."</p>
<p>What did she mean? She had no other meaning than that she would have such
compensation in English society that her American admirers would not be missed.
She did not know of my going abroad.</p>
<p>But Bessie darted a quick glance from her to me, and back again to her, as
though some dawning suspicion had come to her. "I hope," she said quietly, "that
you may have a pleasant winter. It will be delightful, won't it, Charlie?"</p>
<p>"Oh, very!" I answered, but half noting the under-meaning of her words, my
mind running on deck state-rooms and the like.</p>
<p>"Charlie," said Miss Meyrick suddenly, "do you remember what happened two
years ago to-day?"</p>
<p>"No, I think not."</p>
<p>Taking out a little book bound in Russia leather and tipped with gold, she
handed it to Bessie, who ran her eye down the page: it was open at September
28th.</p>
<p>"Read it," said Fanny, settling herself composedly in her shawl, and leaning
back against a tree with half-shut eyes.</p>
<p>"'<i>September 28th</i>'" Bessie read, in clear tones which had a strange
constraint in them, "'Charlie Munro saved my life. I shall love him for ever and
ever. We were out in a boat, we two, on the Hudson&mdash;moonlight&mdash;I was rowing. Dropt
my oar into the water. Leaned out after it and upset the boat. Charlie caught me
and swam with me to shore.'"</p>
<p>A dead silence as Bessie closed the book and held it in her hand.</p>
<p>"Oh," said I lightly, "that isn't worth chronicling&mdash;that! It was no question
of saving lives. The New York boat was coming up, if I remember."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was in trying to steer away from it that I dropped my oar."</p>
<p>"So you see it would have picked us up, any how. There was nothing but the
ducking to remember."</p>
<p>"Such a figure, Bessie! Imagine us running along the road to the gate! I
could scarcely move for my dripping skirts; and we frightened papa so when we
stepped up on the piazza out of the moonlight!"</p>
<p>To stop this torrent of reminiscences, which, though of nothings, I could see
was bringing the red spot to Bessie's cheek, I put out my hand for the book:
"Let me write something down to-day;" and I hastily scribbled: "<i>September</i>
28. Charles Munro and Bessie Stewart, to sail for Europe in ten days, ask of
their friend Fanny Meyrick her warm congratulations."</p>
<p>"Will that do?" I whispered as I handed the book to Bessie.</p>
<p>"Not at all," said Bessie scornfully and coldly, tearing out the leaf as she
spoke and crumpling it in her hand.&mdash;"Sorry to spoil your book, Fanny dear, but
the sentiment would have spoiled it more. Let us go home."</p>
<p>As we passed the hotel on that dreary walk home, Fanny would have left us,
but Bessie clung to her and whispered something in a pleading voice, begging
her, evidently, to come home with us.</p>
<p>"If Mr. Munro will take word to papa," she said, indicating that worthy, who
sat on the upper piazza smoking his pipe.</p>
<p>"We will walk on," said Bessie coldly. "Come, Fanny dear."</p>
<p>Strange, thought I as I turned on my heel, this sudden fond intimacy! Bessie
is angry. Why did I never tell her of the ducking? And yet when I remembered how
Fanny had clung to me, how after we had reached the shore I had been forced to
remind her that it was no time for sentimental gratitude when we both were
shivering, I could see why I had refrained from mentioning it to Bessie until
our closer confidences would allow of it.</p>
<p>No man, unless he be a downright coxcomb, will ever admit to one woman that
another woman has loved him. To his wife&mdash;perhaps. But how much Fanny Meyrick
cared for me I had never sought to know. After the dismal ending of that
moonlight boat-row&mdash;I had been already disenchanted for some time before&mdash;I had
scarce called at Meyrick Place more than civility required. The young lady was
so inclined to exaggerate the circumstance, to hail me as her deliverer, that I
felt like the hero of a melodrama whenever we met. And after I had met Bessie
there were pleasanter things to think about&mdash;much pleasanter.</p>
<p>How exasperating girls can be when they try! I had had my <i>congé</i> for
the walk home, I knew, and I was vexed enough to accept it and stay at the hotel
to dinner.</p>
<p>"I will not be played upon in this way. Bessie knows that I stayed over the
morning train just to be with her, and piled up for to-morrow no end of work, as
well as sarcastic remarks from D. &amp; Co. If she chooses to show off her
affection for Fanny Meyrick in these few hours that we have together&mdash;Fanny
Meyrick whom she <i>hated</i> yesterday&mdash;she may enjoy her friendship undisturbed
by me."</p>
<p>So I loitered with my cigar after dinner, and took a nap on the sofa in my
room. I was piqued, and did not care to conceal it. As the clock struck five I
bethought me it was time to betake me to the Sloman cottage. A sound of wheels
and a carriage turning brought me to the window. The two young ladies were
driving off in Fanny Meyrick's phaeton, having evidently come to the hotel and
waited while it was being made ready.</p>
<p>"Pique for pique! Serves me right, I suppose."</p>
<p>Evening found me at the Sloman cottage, waiting with Mrs. Sloman by the
tea-table. Why do I always remember her, sitting
monumental by the silver urn?</p>
<p>"The girls are very late to-night."</p>
<p>"Yes." I was beginning to be uneasy. It was nearing train-time again.</p>
<p>"Such lovely moonlight, I suppose, has tempted them, or they may be staying
at Foxcroft to tea."</p>
<p>Indeed? I looked at my watch: I had ten minutes.</p>
<p>A sound of wheels: the phaeton drove up.</p>
<p>"Oh, Charlie," said Bessie as she sprang out, "you bad boy! you'll miss your
train again. Fanny here will drive you to the hotel. Jump in, quick!"</p>
<p>And as the moonlight shone full on her face I looked inquiringly into her
eyes.</p>
<p>"The letter," I said, "for Judge Hubbard?" hoping that she would go to the
house for it, and then I could follow her for a word.</p>
<p>"Oh! I had almost forgotten. Here it is;" and she drew it from her pocket and
held it out to me in her gloved hand. I pressed the hand to my lips,
riding-glove and all, and sprang in beside Fanny, who was with some difficulty
making her horse stand still.</p>
<p>"Good-bye!" from the little figure at the gate. "Don't forget, Fanny,
to-morrow at ten;" and we were off.</p>
<p>By the wretched kerosene lamp of the car, going down, I read my letter, for
it was for me: "I will not go to Europe, and I forbid you to mention it again. I
shall never, never forget that <i>I</i> proposed it, and that
you&mdash;<i>accepted</i> it. Come up to Lenox once more before you go."</p>
<p>This was written in ink, and was sealed. It was the morning's note. But
across the envelope these words were written in pencil: "Go to Europe with Fanny
Meyrick, and come up to Lenox, both of you, when you return."</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p>I had a busy week of it in New York&mdash;copying out instructions, taking notes of
marriages and intermarriages in 1690, and writing each day a long, pleading
letter to Bessie. There was a double strain upon me: all the arrangements for my
client's claims, and in an undercurrent the arguments to overcome Bessie's
decision, went on in my brain side by side.</p>
<p>I could not, I wrote to her, make the voyage without her. It would be the
shipwreck of all my new hopes. It was cruel in her to have raised such hopes
unless she was willing to fulfill them: it made the separation all the harder. I
could not and would not give up the plan. "I have engaged our passage in the
Wednesday's steamer: say yes, dear child, and I will write to Dr. Wilder from
here."</p>
<p>I could not leave for Lenox before Saturday morning, and I hoped to be
married on the evening of that day. But to all my pleading came "No," simply
written across a sheet of note-paper in my darling's graceful hand.</p>
<p>Well, I would go up on the Saturday, nevertheless. She would surely yield
when she saw me faithful to my word.</p>
<p>"I shall be a sorry-looking bridegroom," I thought as I surveyed myself in
the little mirror at the office. It was Friday night, and we were shutting up.
We had worked late by gaslight, all the clerks had gone home long ago, and only
the porter remained, half asleep on a chair in the hall.</p>
<p>It was striking nine as I gathered up my bundle of papers and thrust them
into a bag. I was rid of them for three days at least. "Bill, you may lock up
now," I said, tapping the sleepy porter on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Munro, shure here's a card for yees," handing me a lady's card.</p>
<p>"Who left it, Bill?" I hurriedly asked, taking it to the flaring gaslight on
the stairway.</p>
<p>"Two ladies in a carriage&mdash;an old 'un and a pretty young lady, shure. They
charged me giv' it yees, and druv' off."</p>
<p>"And why didn't you bring it in, you blockhead?" I shouted, for it was Bessie
Stewart's card. On it was written in pencil: "Westminster Hotel. On our way
through New York. Leave on the 8 train for the South to-night. Come up to
dinner."</p>
<p>The eight-o'clock train, and it was now striking nine!</p>
<p>"Shure, Mr. Charles, you had said you was not to be disturbed on no account,
and that I was to bring in no messages."</p>
<p>"Did you tell those ladies that? What time were they here?"</p>
<p>"About five o'clock&mdash;just after you had shut the dure, and the clerks was
gone. Indeed, and they didn't wait for no reply, but hearin' you were in there,
they druv' off the minute they give me the card. The pretty young lady didn't
like the looks of our office, I reckon."</p>
<p>It was of no use to storm at Bill. He had simply obeyed orders like a
faithful machine. So, after a hot five minutes, I rushed up to the Westminster.
Perhaps they had not gone. Bessie would know there was a mistake, and would wait
for me.</p>
<p>But they were gone. On the books of the hotel were registered in a clear
hand, Bessie's hand, "Mrs. M. Antoinette Sloman and maid; Miss Bessie Stewart."
They had arrived that afternoon, must have driven directly from the train to the
office, and had dined, after waiting a little time for some one who did not
come.</p>
<p>"And where were they going?" I asked of the sympathetic clerk, who seemed
interested.</p>
<p>"Going South&mdash;I don't know where. The elder lady seemed delicate, and the
young lady quite anxious that she should
stay here to-night and go on in the morning. But no, she would go on
to-night."</p>
<p>I took the midnight train for Philadelphia. They would surely not go farther
to-night if Mrs. Sloman seemed such an invalid.</p>
<p>I scanned every hotel-book in vain. I walked the streets of the city, and all
the long Sunday I haunted one or two churches that my memory suggested to me
were among the probabilities for that day. They were either not in the city or
most securely hid.</p>
<p>And all this time there was a letter in the New York post-office waiting for
me. I found it at my room when I went back to it on Monday noon.</p>
<p>It ran as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">"WESTMINSTER HOTEL. "Very sorry not to see you&mdash;Aunt Sloman
  especially sorry; but she has set her heart on going to Philadelphia to-night.
  We shall stay at a private house, a quiet boarding-house; for aunt goes to
  consult Dr. R&mdash;&mdash; there, and wishes to be very retired. I shall not give you our
  address: as you sail so soon, it would not be worth while to come over. I will
  write you on the other side. B.S." </div>
<p>Where's a Philadelphia directory? Where is this Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;? I find him, sure
enough&mdash;such a number Walnut street. Time is precious&mdash;Monday noon!</p>
<p>"I'll transfer my berth to the Saturday steamer: that will do as well. Can't
help it if they do scold at the office."</p>
<p>To drive to the Cunard company's office and make the transfer took some
little time, but was not this my wedding holiday? I sighed as I again took my
seat in the car at Jersey City. On this golden Monday afternoon I should have
been slowly coming down the Housatonic Valley, with my dear little wife beside
me. Instead, the unfamiliar train, and the fat man at my side reading a campaign
newspaper, and shaking his huge sides over some broad burlesque.</p>
<p>The celebrated surgeon, Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;, was not at home in answer to my ring on
Monday evening.</p>
<p>"How soon will he be in? I will wait."</p>
<p>"He can see no patients to-night sir," said the man; "and he may not be home
until midnight."</p>
<p>"But I am an <i>im</i>patient," I might have urged, when a carriage dashed up
to the door. A slight little man descended, and came slowly up the steps.</p>
<p>"Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;?" I said inquiringly.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Just one minute, doctor, if you please. I only want to get an address from
you."</p>
<p>He scanned me from head to foot: "Walk into my office, young man."</p>
<p>I might have wondered at the brusqueness of his manner had I not caught a
glimpse of myself in the mirror over the mantelshelf. Dusty and worn, and with a
keen look of anxiety showing out of every feature, I should scarcely have
recognized myself.</p>
<p>I explained as collectedly as possible that I wanted the address of one of
his patients, a dear old friend of mine, whom I had missed as she passed through
New York, and that, as I was about to sail for Europe in a few days, I had
rushed over to bid her good-bye. "Mrs. Antoinette Sloman, it is, doctor."</p>
<p>The doctor eyed me keenly: he put out his hand to the little silver bell that
stood on the table and tapped it sharply. The servant appeared at the door: "Let
the carriage wait, James."</p>
<p>Again the watchful, keen expression. Did he think me an escaped lunatic, or
that I had an intent to rob the old lady? Apparently the scrutiny was
satisfactory, for he took out a little black book from his pocket, and turning
over the leaves, said, "Certainly, here it is&mdash;No. 30 Elm street, West
Philadelphia."</p>
<p>Over the river, then, again: no wonder I had not seen them in the Sunday's
search.</p>
<p>"I will take you over," said Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;, replacing the book in his pocket again.
"Mrs. Sloman is on my list. Wait till I eat a biscuit, and I'll drive you over
in my carriage."</p>
<p>Shrewd little man! thought I: if I am a convict or a lunatic with designs on
Mrs. Sloman, he is going to be there to see.</p>
<p>"Till he ate a biscuit?" I should think so. To his invitation, most
courteously urged, that I should come and share his supper&mdash;"You've just come
from the train, and you won't get back to your hotel for two hours, at least"&mdash;I
yielded a ready acceptance, for I was really very hungry: I forget whether I had
eaten anything all day.</p>
<p>But the biscuit proved to be an elegant little supper served in glittering
plate, and the doctor lounged over the tempting bivalves until I could scarce
conceal my impatience.</p>
<p>"Do you chance to know," he said carelessly, as at last we rose from the
table and he flung his napkin down, "Mrs. Sloman's niece, Miss Stewart?"</p>
<p>"Excellently well," I said smiling: "in fact, I believe I am engaged to be
married to her."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," said the doctor, bursting out laughing, "I am delighted to
hear it! Take my carriage and go. I saw you were a lawyer, and you looked
anxious and hurried; and I made up my mind that you had come over to badger the
old lady into making her will. I congratulate you with all my soul&mdash;and myself,
too," he added, shaking my hand. "Only think! Had it not been for your
frankness, I should have taken a five-mile ride to watch you and keep you from
doing my patient an injury."</p>
<p>The good doctor quite hurried me into the carriage in the effusion of his
discovery; and I was soon rolling away in that luxurious vehicle over the
bridge, and toward Bessie at last.</p>
<p>I cannot record that interview in words, nor can I now set down any but the
mere outline of our talk. My darling came down to meet me with a quick flush of
joy that she did not try to conceal. She was natural, was herself, and only too
glad, after the <i>contretemps</i> in New York, to see me again. She pitied me
as though I had been a tired child when I told her pathetically of my two
journeys to Philadelphia, and laughed outright at my interview with Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>I was so sure of my ground. When I came to speak of the journey&mdash;<i>our</i>
journey&mdash;I knew I should prevail. It was a deep wound, and she shrank from any
talk about it. I had to be very gentle and tender before she would listen to me
at all.</p>
<p>But there was something else at work against me&mdash;what was it?&mdash;something that I
could neither see nor divine. And it was not altogether made up of Aunt Sloman,
I was sure.</p>
<p>"I cannot leave her now, Charlie. Dr. R&mdash;&mdash; wishes her to remain in
Philadelphia, so that he can watch her case. That settles it, Charlie: I must
stay with her."</p>
<p>What was there to be said? "Is there no one else, no one to take your
place?"</p>
<p>"Nobody; and I would not leave her even if there were."</p>
<p>Still, I was unsatisfied. A feeling of uneasiness took possession of me. I
seemed to read in Bessie's eyes that there was a thought between us hidden out
of sight. There is no clairvoyant like a lover. I could see the shadow clearly
enough, but whence, in her outer life, had the shadow come? <i>Between</i> us,
surely, it could not be. Even her anxiety for her aunt could not explain it: it
was something concealed.</p>
<p>When at last I had to leave her, "So to-morrow is your last day?" she
said.</p>
<p>"No, not the last. I have changed my passage to the Saturday steamer."</p>
<p>The strange look came into her face again. Never before did blue eyes wear
such a look of scrutiny.</p>
<p>"Well, what is it?" I asked laughingly as I looked straight into her
eyes.</p>
<p>"The Saturday steamer," she said musingly&mdash;"the Algeria, isn't it? I thought
you were in a hurry?"</p>
<p>"It was my only chance to have you," I explained, and apparently the argument
was satisfactory enough.</p>
<p>With the saucy little upward toss with which she always dismissed a subject,
"Then it isn't good-bye to-night?" she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, for two days. I shall run over again on Thursday."</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p>The two days passed, and the Thursday, and the Friday's parting, harder for
Bessie, as it seemed, than she had thought for. It was hard to raise her dear
little head from my shoulder when the last moment came, and to rush down stairs
to the cab, whose shivering horse and implacable driver seemed no bad emblem of
destiny on that raw October morning.</p>
<p>I was glad of the lowering sky as I stepped up the gangway to the ship's
deck. "What might have been" went down the cabin stairs with me; and as I threw
my wraps and knapsack into the double state-room I had chosen I felt like a
widower.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to me then, as I sat down on the side of the berth and
looked around me, how the last two weeks had filled all the future with dreams.
"I must have a genius for castle-building," I laughed. "Well, the reality is
cold and empty enough. I'll go up on deck."</p>
<p>On deck, among the piles of luggage, were various metal-covered trunks marked
M&mdash;&mdash;. I remember now watching them as they were stowed away.</p>
<p>But it was with a curious shock, an hour after we had left the dock, that a
turn in my solitary walk on deck brought me face to face with Fanny Meyrick.</p>
<p>"You here?" she said. "I thought you had sailed in the Russia! Bessie told me
you were to go then."</p>
<p>"Did she know," I asked, "that <i>you</i> were going by this steamer?"</p>
<p>On my life, never was gallantry farther from my thoughts: my question
concerned Bessie alone, but Fanny apparently took it as a compliment, and looked
up gayly: "Oh yes: that was fixed months ago. I told her about it at Lenox."</p>
<p>"And did she tell you something else?" I asked sharply.</p>
<p>"Oh yes. I was very glad to hear of your good prospect. Do be congratulated,
won't you?"</p>
<p>Rather an odd way to put it, thought I, but it is Fanny Meyrick's way. "Good
prospect!" Heavens! was that the term to apply to my engagement with Bessie?</p>
<p>I should have insisted on a distincter utterance and a more flattering
expression of the situation had it been any other woman. But a lingering
suspicion that perhaps the subject was a distasteful one to Fanny Meyrick made
me pause, and a few moments after, as some one else joined her, I left her and
went to the smokestack for my cigar.</p>
<p>It was impossible, in the daily monotony of ship-life, to avoid altogether
the young lady whom Fate had thrown in my way. She was a most provokingly good
sailor, too. Other women stayed below or were carried in limp bundles to the
deck at noon; but Fanny, perfectly poised, with the steady glow in her cheek,
was always ready to amuse or be amused.</p>
<p>I tried, at first, keeping out of her way, with the <i>Trois
Mousquetaires</i> for company. But it seemed to me, as she knew of my
engagement, such avoidance was anything but complimentary to her. Loyalty to her
sex would forbid me to show that I had read her secret. Why not meet her on the
frank, breezy ground of friendship?</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, there was no secret. Perhaps her feeling was only one of
girlish gratitude, however needless, for pulling her out of the Hudson River. I
did not know.</p>
<p>Nor was I particularly pleased with the companion to whom she introduced me
on our third day out&mdash;Father Shamrock, an Irish priest, long resident in America,
and bound now for Maynooth. How he had obtained an introduction to her I do not
know, except in the easy, fatherly way he seemed to have with every one on
board.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" thought I, "what a nuisance!" for I shared the common antipathy to
his country and his creed. Nor was his appearance prepossessing&mdash;one of Froude's
"tonsured peasants," as I looked down at the square shoulders,
the stout, short figure and the broad
beardlessness of the face of the padre. But his voice, rich and mellow,
attracted me in spite of myself. His eyes were sparkling with kindly humor, and
his laugh was irresistible.</p>
<p>A perfect man of the world, with no priestly austerity about him, he seemed a
perpetual anxiety to the two young priests at his heels. They were on their
dignity always, and, though bound to hold him in reverence as their superior in
age and rank, his songs and his gay jests were evidently as thorns in their new
cassocks.</p>
<p>Father Shamrock was soon the star of the ship's company. Perfectly suave, his
gayety had rather the French sparkle about it than the distinguishing Italian
trait, and his easy manner had a dash of manliness which I had not thought to
find. Accomplished in various tongues, rattling off a gay little <i>chanson</i>
or an Irish song, it was a sight to see the young priests looking in from time
to time at the cabin door in despair as the clock pointed to nine, and Father
Shamrock still sat the centre of a gay and laughing circle.</p>
<p>He had rare tact, too, in talking to women. Of all the ladies on the Algeria,
I question if there were any but the staunchest Protestants. Some few held
themselves aloof at first and declined an introduction. "Father Shamrock! An
Irish priest! How <i>can</i> Miss Meyrick walk with him and present him as she
does?" But the party of recalcitrants grew less and less, and Fanny Meyrick was
very frank in her admiration. "Convert you?" she laughed over her shoulder to
me. "He wouldn't take the trouble to try."</p>
<p>And I believe, indeed, he would not. His strong social nature was evidently
superior to any ambition of his cloth. He would have made a famous diplomat but
for the one quality of devotion that was lacking. I use the word in its
essential, not in its religious sense&mdash;devotion to an idea, the faith in a high
purpose.</p>
<p>We had one anxious day of it, and only one. A gale had driven most of the
passengers to the seclusion of their state-rooms, and left the dinner-table a
desert. Alone in the cabin, Father Shamrock, Fanny Meyrick, a young Russian and
myself: I forget a vigilant duenna, the only woman on board unreconciled to
Father Shamrock. She lay prone on one of the seats, her face rigid and hands
clasped in an agony of terror. She was afraid, she afterward confessed to me, to
go to her state-room: nearness and voices seemed a necessity to her.</p>
<p>When I joined the party, Father Shamrock, as usual, was the narrator. But he
had dropped out of his voice all the gay humor, and was talking very soberly.
Some story he was telling, of which I gathered, as he went on, that it was of a
young lady, a rich and brilliant society woman. "Shot right through the heart at
Chancellorsville, and he the only brother. They two, orphans, were all that were
left of the family. He was her darling, just two years younger than she.</p>
<p>"I went to see her, and found her in an agony. She had not kissed him when he
left her: some little laughing tiff between them, and she had expected to see
him again before his regiment marched. She threw herself on her knees and made
confession; and then she took a holy vow: if the saints would grant her once
more to behold his body, she would devote herself hereafter to God's holy
Church.</p>
<p>"She gathered all her jewels together in a heap and cast them at my feet.
'Take them, Father, for the Church: if I find him I shall not wear them again&mdash;or
if I do not find him.'</p>
<p>"I went with her to the front of battle, and we found him after a time. It
was a search, but we found his grave, and we brought him home with us. Poor boy!
beyond recognition, except for the ring he wore; but she gave him the last kiss,
and then she was ready to leave the world. She took the vows as Sister Clara,
the holy vows of poverty and charity."</p>
<p>"But, Father," said Fanny, with a new depth in her eyes, "did she not die
behind the bars? To be shut up in a convent
with that grief at her heart!"</p>
<p>"Bars there were none," said the Father gently. "She left her vocation to me,
and I decided for her to become a Sister of Mercy. I have little sympathy," with
a shrug half argumentative, half deprecatory&mdash;"but little sympathy with the
conventual system for spirits like hers. She would have wasted and worn away in
the offices of prayer. She needed <i>action</i>. And she had the full of it in
her calling. She went from bedside to bedside of the sick and dying&mdash;here a child
in a fever; there a widow-woman in the last stages of consumption&mdash;night after
night, and day after day, with no rest, no thought of herself."</p>
<p>"Oh, I have seen her," I could not help interposing, "in a city car. A
shrouded figure that was conspicuous even in her serge dress. She read a book of
<i>Hours</i> all the time, but I caught one glimpse of her eyes: they were very
brilliant."</p>
<p>"Yes," sighed the Father, "it was an unnatural brightness. I was called away
to Montreal, or I should never have permitted the sacrifice. She went where-ever
the worst cases were of contagion and poverty, and she would have none to
relieve her at her post. So, when I returned after three months' absence, I was
shocked at the change: she was dying of their family disease. 'It is better,
so,' she said, 'dear Father. It was only the bullet that saved Harry from it,
and it would have been sure to come to me at last, after some opera or ball.'
She died last winter&mdash;so patient and pure, and such a saintly sufferer!"</p>
<p>The Father wiped his eyes. Why should I think of Bessie? Why should the
Sister's veiled figure and pale ardent face rise before me as if in warning?</p>
<p>Of just such overwhelming sacrifice was my darling capable were her life's
purpose wrecked. Something there was in the portrait of the sweet singleness,
the noble scorn of self, the devotion unthinking, uncalculating, which I knew
lay hidden in her soul.</p>
<p>The Father warmed into other themes, all in the same key of mother Church. I
listened dreamily, and to my own thoughts as well.</p>
<p>He pictured the priest's life of poverty, renunciation, leaving the world of
men, the polish and refinement of scholars, to take the confidences and bear the
burdens of grimy poverty and ignorance. Surely, I thought, we do wrong to shut
such men out of our sympathies, to label them "Dangerous." Why should we turn
the cold shoulder? are we so true to our ideals? But one glance at the young
priests as they sat crouching in the outer cabin, telling their beads and
crossing themselves with the vehemence of a frightened faith, was enough. Father
Shamrock was no type. Very possibly his own life would show but coarse and poor
against the chaste, heroic portraits he had drawn. He had the dramatic faculty:
for the moment he was what he related&mdash;that was all.</p>
<p>Our vigilant duenna had gradually risen to a sitting posture, and drawn
nearer and nearer, and as the narrator's voice sank into silence she said with
effusion, "Well, <i>you</i> are a good man, I guess."</p>
<p>But Fanny Meyrick sat as if entranced. The gale had died away, and, to break
the spell, I asked her if she wanted to take one peep on deck, to see if there
was a star in the heavens.</p>
<p>There was no star, but a light rising and falling with the ship's motion,
which was pronounced by a sailor to be Queenstown light, shone in the
distance.</p>
<p>The Father was to leave us there. "We shall not make it to-night," said the
sailor. "It is too rough. Early in the morning the passengers will land."</p>
<p>"I wish," said Fanny with a deep sigh, as if wakening from a dream, "that the
Church of Rome was at the bottom of the sea!"</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p>Arrived at our dock, I hurried off to catch the train for London. The
Meyricks lingered for a few weeks in Wales before coming to settle down for the
winter. I was glad of it, for I could make my arrangements unhampered.
So I carefully eliminated Clarges street from my
list of lodging-houses, and finally "ranged" myself with a neat landlady in
Sackville street.</p>
<p>How anxiously I awaited the first letter from Bessie! As the banker's clerk
handed it over the counter to me, instead of the heavy envelope I had hoped for,
it was a thin slip of an affair that fluttered away from my hand. It was so very
slim and light that I feared to open it there, lest it should be but a mocking
envelope, nothing more.</p>
<p>So I hastened back to my cab, and, ordering the man to drive to the
law-offices, tore it open as I jumped in. It enclosed simply a printed slip, cut
from some New York paper&mdash;a list of the Algeria's passengers.</p>
<p>"What joke is this?" I said as I scanned it more closely.</p>
<p>By some spite of fortune my name was printed directly after the Meyrick
party. Was it for this, this paltry thing, that Bessie has denied me a word? I
turned over the envelope, turned it inside out&mdash;not a penciled word even!</p>
<p>The shadow that I had seen on that good-bye visit to Philadelphia was clear
to me now. I had said at Lenox, repeating the words after Bessie with fatal
emphasis, "I am glad, very glad, that Fanny Meyrick is to sail in October. I
would not have her stay on this side for worlds!" Then the next day, twenty-four
hours after, I told her that I too was going abroad. Coward that I was, not to
tell her at first! She might have been sorry, vexed, but not
<i>suspicious</i>.</p>
<p>Yes, that was the ugly word I had to admit, and to admit that I had given it
room to grow.</p>
<p>My first hesitancy about taking her with me, my transfer from the Russia to
the later steamer, and, to crown all, that leaf from Fanny's pocket-book: "I
shall love him for ever and ever"!</p>
<p>And yet she <i>had</i> faith in me. She had told Fanny Meyrick we were
engaged. <i>Had she not</i>?</p>
<p>My work in London was more tedious and engrossing than I had expected. Even a
New York lawyer has much to learn of the law's delay in those pompous old
offices amid the fog. Had I been working for myself, I should have thrown up the
case in despair, but advices from our office said "Stick to it," and I
stayed.</p>
<p>Eating out my own heart with anxiety whenever I thought of my home affair,
perhaps it was well for me that I had the monotonous, musty work that required
little thought, but only a persistent plodding and a patient holding of my end
of the clue.</p>
<p>In all these weeks I had nothing from Bessie save that first cruel envelope.
Letter after letter went to her, but no response came. I wrote to Mrs. Sloman
too, but no answer. Then I bethought me of Judge Hubbard, but received in reply
a note from one of his sons, stating that his father was in Florida&mdash;that he had
communicated with him, but regretted that he was unable to give me Miss
Stewart's present address.</p>
<p>Why did I not seek Fanny Meyrick? She must have come to London long since,
and surely the girls were in correspondence. I was too proud. She knew of our
relations: Bessie had told her. I could not bring myself to reveal to her how
tangled and gloomy a mystery was between us. I could explain nothing without
letting her see that she was the unconscious cause.</p>
<p>At last, when one wretched week after another had gone by, and we were in the
new year, I could bear it no longer. "Come what will, I must know if Bessie
writes to her."</p>
<p>I went to Clarges street. My card was carried into the Meyricks' parlor, and
I followed close upon it. Fanny was sitting alone, reading by a table. She
looked up in surprise as I stood in the doorway. A little coldly, I thought, she
came forward to meet me, but her manner changed as she took my hand.</p>
<p>"I was going to scold you, Charlie, for avoiding us, for staying away so
long, but that is accounted for now. Why didn't you send us word that you were
ill? Papa is a capital nurse."</p>
<p>"But I have not been ill," I said, bewildered, "only very busy and very
anxious."</p>
<p>"I should think so," still holding my hand, and looking into my face with an
expression of deep concern. "Poor fellow! You do look worn. Come right here to
this chair by the fire, and let me take care of you. You need rest."</p>
<p>And she rang the bell. I suffered myself to be installed in the soft crimson
chair by the fire. It was such a comfort to hear a friendly voice after all
those lonely weeks! When the servant entered with a tray, I watched her
movements over the tea-cups with a delicious sense of the womanly presence and
the home-feeling stealing over me.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine what keeps papa," she said, chatting away with woman's tact:
"he always smokes after dinner, and comes up to me for his cup of tea
afterward."</p>
<p>Then, as she handed me a tiny porcelain cup, steaming and fragrant, "I should
never have congratulated you, Charlie, on board the steamer if I had known it
was going to end in this way."</p>
<p><i>This way</i>! Then Bessie must have told her.</p>
<p>"End?" I said stammering: "what&mdash;what end?"</p>
<p>"In wearing you out. Bessie told me at Lenox, the day we took that long walk,
that you had this important case, and it was a great thing for a young lawyer to
have such responsibility."</p>
<p>Poor little porcelain cup! It fell in fragments on the floor as I jumped to
my feet: "Was that <i>all</i> she told you? Didn't she tell you that we were
engaged?"</p>
<p>For a moment Fanny did not speak. The scarlet glow on her cheek, the steady
glow that was always there, died away suddenly and left her pale as ashes.
Mechanically she opened and shut the silver sugar-tongs that lay on the table
under her hand, and her eyes were fixed on me with a wild, beseeching
expression.</p>
<p>"Did you not know," I said in softer tones, still standing by the table and
looking down on her, "that day at Lenox that we were engaged? Was it not for
<i>that</i> you congratulated me on board the steamer?"</p>
<p>A deep-drawn sigh as she whispered, "Indeed, no! Oh dear! what have I
done?"</p>
<p>"You?&mdash;nothing!" I said with a sickly smile; "but there is some mistake, some
mystery. I have never had one line from Bessie since I reached London, and when
I left her she was my own darling little wife that was to be."</p>
<p>Still Fanny sat pale as ashes, looking into the fire and muttering to
herself. "Heavens! To think&mdash;Oh, Charlie," with a sudden burst, "it's all my
doing! How can I ever tell you?"</p>
<p>"You hear from Bessie, then? Is she&mdash;is she well? Where is she? What is all
this?" And I seated myself again and tried to speak calmly, for I saw that
something very painful was to be said&mdash;something that she could hardly say; and I
wanted to help her, though how I knew not.</p>
<p>At this moment the door opened and "papa" came in. He evidently saw that he
had entered upon a scene as his quick eye took in the situation, but whether I
was accepted or rejected as the future son-in-law even his penetration was at
fault to discover.</p>
<p>"Oh, papa," said Fanny, rising with evident relief, "just come and talk to
Mr. Munro while I get him a package he wants to take with him."</p>
<p>It took a long time to prepare that package. Mr. Meyrick, a cool, shrewd man
of the world, was taking a mental inventory of me, I felt all the time. I was
conscious that I talked incoherently and like a school-boy of the treaty. Every
American in London was bound to have his special opinion thereupon, and Meyrick,
I found, was of the English party. Then we discussed the special business which
had brought me to England.</p>
<p>"A very unpresentable son-in-law," I read in his eye, while he was evidently
astonished at his daughter's prolonged absence.</p>
<p>Our talk flagged and the fire grew gray in its flaky ashes before Fanny again
appeared.</p>
<p>"I know, papa, you think me very rude to keep Mr. Munro so long waiting,
but there were some special directions to go
with the packet, and it took me a long time to get them right. It is for Bessie,
papa&mdash;Bessie Stewart, Mr. Munro's dear little <i>fiancée</i>."</p>
<p>Escaping as quickly as possible from Mr. Meyrick's neatly turned
felicitations&mdash;and that the satisfaction he expressed was genuine I was prepared
to believe&mdash;hurried home to Sackville street.</p>
<p>My bedroom was always smothering in its effect on me&mdash;close draperies to the
windows, heavy curtains around the bed&mdash;and I closed the door and lighted my
candle with a sinking heart.</p>
<p>The packet was simply a long letter, folded thickly in several wrappers and
tied with a string. The letter opened abruptly:</p>
<p>"What I am going to do I am sure no woman on earth ever did before me, nor
would I save to undo the trouble I have most innocently made. What must you have
thought of me that day at Lenox, staying close all day to two engaged people,
who must have wished me away a thousand times? But I did not dream you were
engaged.</p>
<p>"Remember, I had just come over from Saratoga, and knew nothing of Lenox
gossip, then or afterward. Something in your manner once or twice made me look
at you and think that perhaps you were <i>interested</i> in Bessie, but hers to
you was so cold, so distant, that I thought it was only a notion of my jealous
self.</p>
<p>"Was I foolish to lay so much stress on that anniversary time? Do you know
that the year before we had spent it together, too?&mdash;September 28th. True, that
year it was at Bertie Cox's funeral, but we had walked together, and I was happy
in being near you.</p>
<p>"For, you see, it was from something more than the Hudson River that you had
brought me out. You had rescued me from the stupid gayety of my first
winter&mdash;from the flats of fashionable life. You had given me an ideal&mdash;something
to live up to and grow worthy of.</p>
<p>"Let that pass. For myself, it is nothing, but for the deeper harm I have
done, I fear, to Bessie and to you.</p>
<p>"Again, on that day at Lenox, when Bessie and I drove together in the
afternoon, I tried to make her talk about you, to find out what you were to her.
But she was so distant, so repellant, that I fancied there was nothing at all
between you; or, rather, if you had cared for her at all, that she had been
indifferent to you.</p>
<p>"Indeed, she quite forbade the subject by her manner; and when she told me
you were going abroad, I could not help being very happy, for I thought then
that I should have you all to myself.</p>
<p>"When I saw you on shipboard, I fancied, somehow, that you had changed your
passage to be with us. It was very foolish; and I write it, thankful that you
are not here to see me. So I scribbled a little note to Bessie, and sent it off
by the pilot: I don't know where you were when the pilot went. This is, as
nearly as I remember it, what I wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"'DEAR BESSIE: Charlie Munro is on board. He must have changed his
  passage to be with us. I know from something that he has just told <i>me</i>
  that this is so, and that he consoles himself already for your coldness. You
  remember what I told you when we talked about him. I shall <i>try</i> now.
  F.M.' </div>

<p>"Bessie would know what that meant. Oh, must I tell you what a weak, weak
girl I was? When I found out at Lenox, as I thought, that Bessie did not care
for you, I said to her that once I thought you <i>had</i> cared for me, but that
papa had offended you by his manner&mdash;you weren't of an old Knickerbocker family,
you know&mdash;and had given you to understand that your visits were not
acceptable.</p>
<p>"I am sure now that it was because I wanted to think so that I put that
explanation upon your ceasing to visit me, and because papa always looked so
decidedly <i>queer</i> whenever your name was mentioned.</p>
<p>"I had always had everything in life that I wanted, and I believed that in
due time you would come back to me.</p>
<p>"Bessie knew well enough what that
pilot-letter meant, for here is her answer."</p>
<p>Pinned fast to the end of Fanny's letter, so that by no chance should I read
it first, were these words in my darling's hand:</p>
<p>"Got your pilot-letter. Aunt is much better. We shall be traveling about so
much that you need not write me the progress of your romance, but believe me I
shall be most interested in its conclusion. BESSIE S."</p>
<p>It was all explained now. My darling, so sensitive and spirited, had given
her leave "to try."</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p>But was that all? Was she wearing away the slow months in passionate unbelief
of me? I could not tell. But before I slept that night I had taken my resolve. I
would sail for home by the next steamer. The case would suffer, perhaps, by the
delay and the change of hands: D&mdash;&mdash; must come out to attend to it himself, then,
but I would suffer no longer.</p>
<p>No use to write to Bessie. I had exhausted every means to reach her save that
of the detectives. "I'll go to the office, file my papers till the next man
comes over, see Fanny Meyrick, and be off."</p>
<p>But what to say to Fanny? Good, generous girl! She had indeed done what few
women in the world would have had the courage to do&mdash;shown her whole heart to a
man who loved another. It would be an embarrassing interview; and I was not
sorry when I started out that morning that it was too early yet to call.</p>
<p>To the office first, then, I directed my steps. But here Fate lay
<i>perdu</i> and in wait for me.</p>
<p>"A letter, Mr. Munro, from D&mdash;&mdash; &amp; Co.," said the brisk young clerk. They
had treated me with great respect of late, for, indeed, our claim was steadily
growing in weight, and was sure to come right before long. I opened and
read:</p>
<p>"The missing paper is found on this side of the Atlantic&mdash;what you have been
rummaging for all winter on the other. A trusty messenger sails at once, and
will report himself to you."</p>
<p>"At once!" Well, there's only a few days' delay, at most. Perhaps it's young
Bunker. He can take the case and end it: anybody can end it now.</p>
<p>And my heart was light. "A few days," I said to myself as I ran up the steps
in Clarges street.</p>
<p>"Miss Fanny at home?" to the man, or rather to the member of Parliament, who
opened the door&mdash;"Miss Meyrick, I mean."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;in the drawing-room, sir;" and he announced me with a flourish.</p>
<p>Fanny sat in the window. She might have been looking out for me, for on my
entrance she parted the crimson curtains and came forward.</p>
<p>Again the clear glow in her cheek, the self-possessed Fanny of old.</p>
<p>"Charlie," she began impetuously, "I have been thinking over shipboard and
Father Shamrock, and all. You didn't think then&mdash;did you?&mdash;that I cared so very
much for you? I am so glad that the Father bewitched me as he did, for I can
remember no foolishness on my part to you, sir&mdash;none at all. Can you?"</p>
<p>Stammering, confused, I seemed to have lost my tongue and my head together. I
had expected tears, pale cheeks, a burst of self-reproach, and that I should
have to comfort and be very gentle and sympathetic. I had dreaded the
<i>rôle</i>; but here was a new turn of affairs; and, I own it, my self-love was
not a little wounded. The play was played out, that was evident. The curtain had
fallen, and here was I, a late-arrived hero of romance, the chivalric elder
brother, with all my little stock of property-phrases&mdash;friendship of a life,
esteem, etc.&mdash;of no more account than a week-old playbill.</p>
<p>For, I must confess it, I had rehearsed some little forgiveness scene, in
which I should magnanimously kiss her hand, and tell her that I should honor her
above all women for her courage and her truth; and in which she would cry
until her poor little heart was soothed and
calmed; and that I should have the sweet consciousness of being beloved, however
hopelessly, by such a brilliant, ardent soul.</p>
<p>But Mistress Fanny had quietly turned the tables on me, and I believe I was
angry enough for the moment to wish it had not been so.</p>
<p>But only for a moment. It began to dawn upon me soon, the rare tact which had
made easy the most embarrassing situation in the world&mdash;the <i>bravura</i>
style, if I may call it so, that had carried us over such a difficult bar.</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> delicacy, this careless reminder of the fascinating Father, and
perhaps there was a modicum of truth in that acknowledgment too.</p>
<p>I took my leave of Fanny Meyrick, and walked home a wiser man.</p>
<p>But the trusty messenger, who arrived three days later, was not, as I had
hoped, young Bunker or young Anybody. It was simply Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;, with a large
traveling party. They came straight to London, and summoned me at once to the
Langham Hotel.</p>
<p>I suppose I looked somewhat amazed at sight of the portly lady, whom I had
last seen driving round Central Park. But the twin Skye terriers who tumbled in
after her assured me of her identity soon enough.</p>
<p>"Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; charged me, Mr. Munro," she began after our first ceremonious
greeting, "to give this into no hands but yours. I have kept it securely with my
diamonds, and those I always carry about me."</p>
<p>From what well-stitched diamond receptacle she had extracted the paper I did
not suffer myself to conjecture, but the document was strongly perfumed with
violet powder.</p>
<p>"You see, I was coming over," she proceeded to explain, "in any event, and
when Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; talked of sending Bunker&mdash;I think it was Bunker&mdash;with us, I persuaded
him to let me be messenger instead. It wasn't worth while, you know, to have any
more people leave the office, you being away, and&mdash;Oh, Ada, my dear, here is Mr.
Munro!"</p>
<p>As Ada, a slim, willowy creature, with the <i>surprised</i> look in her eyes
that has become the fashion of late, came gliding up to me, I thought that the
reason for young Bunker's omission from the party was possibly before me.</p>
<p>Bother on her matrimonial, or rather anti-matrimonial, devices! Her maternal
solicitude lest Ada should be charmed with the poor young clerk on the passage
over had cost me weeks of longer stay. For at this stage a request for any
further transfer would have been ridiculous and wrong. As easy to settle it now
as to arrange for any one else; so the first of April found me still in London,
but leaving it on the morrow for home.</p>
<p>"Bessie is in Lenox, I think," Fanny Meyrick had said to me as I bade her
good-bye.</p>
<p>"What! You have heard from her?"</p>
<p>"No, but I heard incidentally from one of my Boston friends this morning that
he had seen her there, standing on the church steps."</p>
<p>I winced, and a deeper glow came into Fanny's cheek.</p>
<p>"You will give her my letter? I would have written to her also, but it was
indeed only this morning that I heard. You will give her that?"</p>
<p>"I have kept it for her," I said quietly; and the adieus were over.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p>Lenox again, and bluebirds darting to and fro among the maples. I had reached
the hotel at midnight. Our train was late, detained on the road, and though my
thoughts drove instantly to the Sloman cottage, I allowed the tardier
coach-horses to set me down at the hotel. I had not telegraphed from New York. I
would give her no chance to withhold herself from me, or to avoid me by running
away. There was no time for her, as yet, to have read of the ship's arrival. I
would take her unawares.</p>
<p>So, after the bountiful Nora, who presides over the comfort of her favorites,
had plied me with breakfast-cakes and milk and honey, I sauntered down toward
the Lebanon road. Yes, sauntered, for I felt that a great crisis in my life was
at hand, and at such times a wonderful calmness, almost to lethargy, possesses
me. I went slowly up the hill. The church-clock was striking nine&mdash;calm, peaceful
strokes. There was no tremor in them, no warning of what was coming. The air was
very still, and I stopped a moment to watch the bluebirds before I turned into
the Lebanon road.</p>
<p>There was the little gray cottage, with its last year's vines about it, a
withered spray here and there waving feebly as the soft April air caught it and
tossed it to and fro. No sign of life about the cottage&mdash;doors and windows tight
shut and barred. Only the little gate swung open, but that might have been the
wind. I stepped up on the porch. No sound save the echo of my steps and the
knocking of my heart. I rang the bell. It pealed violently, but there were no
answering sounds: nothing stirred.</p>
<p>I rang again, more gently, and waited, looking along the little path to the
gate. There was snow, the winter's snow, lingering about the roots of the old
elm, the one elm tree that overhung the cottage. Last winter's snow lying there,
and of the people who had lived in the house, and made it warm and bright, not a
footprint, not a trace!</p>
<p>Again I rang, and this time I heard footsteps coming round the corner of the
house. I sat down on the rustic bench by the door. If it had been Bessie's self,
I could not have stirred, I was so chilled, so awed by the blank silence. A
brown sun-bonnet, surmounting a tall, gaunt figure, came in sight.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked the owner of the sun-bonnet in a quick, sharp voice that
seemed the prelude to "Don't want any."</p>
<p>"Where are Mrs. Sloman and Miss Stewart? Are they not in Lenox?"</p>
<p>"Miss' Sloman, she's away to Minnarsoter: ben thar' all winter for her
health. She don't cal'late to be home afore June."</p>
<p>"And Miss Stewart?&mdash;is she with her?"</p>
<p>"Miss Stewart? I dunno," said the woman, with a strange look about the
corners of her mouth. "I dunno: I never see her; and the family was all away
afore I came here to take charge. They left the kitchen-end open for me; and my
sister-in-law&mdash;that's Hiram Splinter's wife&mdash;she made all the 'rangements. But I
<i>did</i> hear," hesitating a moment, "as how Bessie Stewart was away to Shaker
Village; and some does say"&mdash;a portentous pause and clearing of her throat&mdash;"that
she's jined."</p>
<p>"<i>Joined</i>&mdash;what?" I asked, all in a mist of impatience and
perplexity.</p>
<p>"Jined the Shakers."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" I said, recovering my breath angrily. "Where is this Hiram's
wife? Let me see her."</p>
<p>"In the back lot&mdash;there where you see the yaller house where the chimney's
smoking. That's Hiram's house. He has charge of the Gold property on the hill.
Won't you come in and warm yourself by the
fire in the kitchen? I was away to the next neighbor's, and I was sure I hear
our bell a-ringin'. Did you hev' to ring long?"</p>
<p>But I was away, striding over the cabbage-patch and climbing the worm-fence
that shut in the estate of Hiram. Some wretched mistake: the woman does not know
what she's talking about. These Splinters! they seem to have had some
communication with Mrs. Sloman: they will know.</p>
<p>Mrs. Splinter, a neat, bright-eyed woman of about twenty-five, opened the
door at my somewhat peremptory knock. I recollected her in a moment as a
familiar face&mdash;some laundress or auxiliary of the Sloman family in some way; and
she seemed to recognize me as well: "Why! it's Mr. Munro! Walk in, sir, and sit
down," dusting off a chair with her apron as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Miss Stewart&mdash;where is she? <i>You</i> know."</p>
<p>"Miss Stewart?" said the woman, sinking down into a chair and looking greatly
disturbed. "Miss Stewart's gone to live with the Shakers. My husband drove her
over with his team&mdash;her and her trunk."</p>
<p>"Why, where was her aunt? Did Mrs. Sloman know? Why isn't Miss Bessie with
her?"</p>
<p>"Miss' Sloman said all she could&mdash;<i>afterward</i> I guess," said the woman,
wiping her eyes, "but 'twan't no use then. You see, Miss' Sloman had jined a
party that was goin' to Minnesota&mdash;while she was in Philadelfy, that was&mdash;and Miss
Stewart she wasn't goin'. She reckoned she'd spend the winter here in the house.
Miss' Sloman's maid&mdash;that's Mary&mdash;was goin' with her to the West, and I was to
hire my sister-in-law to take charge of things here, so that Miss Bessie could
have her mind free-like to come and go. But afore ever Mary Jane&mdash;that's my
sister-in-law&mdash;could come over from Lee, where she was livin' out, Miss Bessie
comes up and opens the house. She stayed there about a week, and she had lots of
company while she was here. I think she got tired. They was people that was just
goin' to sail for Europe, and as soon as they went she just shut up and told me
to send for Mary Jane to take care of things. So Mary Jane never see her, and
perhaps she giv' you a crooked answer, sir, if you was inquirin' of her over to
the cottage."</p>
<p>"Where's Hiram? where's your husband? Can I have his team this morning?"</p>
<p>"I guess so," said the sympathetic Mrs. Splinter. "He'll show you the very
house he druv' her to."</p>
<p>Hiram was hunted for and found; and an hour later I was bowling along the
Lebanon road behind the bay team he was so proud of. I had concluded to take
him with me, as he could identify places and people, and I knew well what
castles the Shaker houses are for the world's people outside. Hiram was full of
talk going over. He seemed to have been bottling it up, and I was the first
auditor for his wrath. "I know 'm," he said, cracking his whip over his horses'
heads. "They be sharp at a bargain, they be. If they've contrived to get a hold
on Bessie Stewart, property and all, it'll go hard on 'em to give her up."</p>
<p>"A <i>hold</i> on Bessie!" What dreadful words! I bade him sharply hold his
tongue and mind his horses, but he went on muttering in an undertone, "Yo'll
see, yo'll see! You're druv' pretty hard, young man, I expect, so I won't think
nothing of your ha'sh words, and we'll get her out, for all Elder Nebson."</p>
<p>So Hiram, looked out along the road from under his huge fur-cap, and up hill
and down. The miles shortened, until at last the fair houses and barns of the
Shaker village came in sight. A sleeping village, one would have thought. Nobody
in the road save one old man, who eyed us suspiciously through the back of a
chair he was carrying.</p>
<p>"It must be dinner-time, I think," said Hiram as he drove cautiously along.
Stopping at a house near the bridge: "Now this is the very house. Just you go
right up and knock at that 'ere door."</p>
<p>I knocked. In a twinkling the door was
opened by a neat Shaker sister, whose round, smiling face was flushed, as though
she had just come from cooking dinner. I stepped across the threshold: "Bessie
Stewart is here. Please say to her that a friend&mdash;a friend from England&mdash;wishes to
see her."</p>
<p>"Sure," said the motherly-faced woman, for she was sweet and motherly in
spite of her Shaker garb, "I'll go and see."</p>
<p>Smilingly she ushered me into a room at the left of the hall. "Take seat,
please;" and with a cheerful alacrity she departed, closing the door gently
behind her.</p>
<p>"Well," thought I, "this is pleasant: no bolts or bars here. I'm sure of one
friend at court."</p>
<p>I had leisure to observe the apartment&mdash;the neatly-scrubbed floor, with one
narrow cot bed against the wall, a tall bureau on which some brown old books
were lying, and the little dust-pan and dust-brush on a brass nail in the
corner. There was a brightly polished stove with no fire in it, and some
straight-backed chairs of yellow wood stood round the room. An open door into a
large, roomy closet showed various garments of men's apparel hanging upon the
wall. The plain thermometer in the window casement seemed the one article of
luxury or ornament in the apartment. I believe I made my observations on all
these things aloud, concluding with, "Oh, Bessie! Bessie! you shall not stay
here." I know that I was startled enough by the apparition of a man standing in
the open closet door. He must have been within it at my entrance, and had heard
all I said.</p>
<p>He came forward, holding out his hand&mdash;very friendly apparently. Then,
requesting me to be seated, he drew out a chair from the wall and sat down,
tilting it back on two legs and leaning against the wall, with his hands folded
before him. Some commonplace remark about the weather, which I answered, led to
a rambling conversation, in which he expressed the greatest curiosity as to
worldly matters, and asked several purely local questions about the city of New
York. Perhaps his ignorance was feigned. I do not know, but I found myself
relating, <i>à la</i> Stanley-Livingstone, some of the current events of the
day. His face was quite intelligent, tanned with labor in the fields, and his
brown eyes were kind and soft, like those of some dumb animals. I note his eyes
here especially, as different in expression from those of others of his
sect.</p>
<p>Several times during the conversation I heard footsteps in the hall, and
darted from my seat, and finally, in my impatience, began to pace the floor.
Kindly as he looked, I did not wish to question the man about Bessie. I would
rely upon the beaming portress, whose "<i>Sure</i>" was such an earnest of her
good-will. Moreover, a feeling of contempt, growing out of pity, was taking
possession of me. This man, in what did he differ from the Catholic priest save
in the utter selfishness of his creed? Beside the sordid accumulation of gain to
which his life was devoted the priest's mission among crowded alleys and
fever-stricken lanes seemed luminous and grand. A moral suicide, with no
redeeming feature. The barns bursting with fatness, the comfortable houses, gain
added to gain&mdash;to what end? I was beginning to give very short answers indeed to
his questions, and was already meditating a foray through the rest of the house,
when the door opened slowly and a lady-abbess entered. She was stiff and
stately, with the most formal neckerchief folded precisely over her straitened
bust, a clear-muslin cap concealing her hair, and her face, stony, blue-eyed and
cold&mdash;a pale, frozen woman standing stately there.</p>
<p>"Bessie Stewart?" said I. "She is here&mdash;I know it. Do not detain her. I must
see her. Why all this delay?"</p>
<p>"Dost thou mean Sister Eliza?" she asked in chilling tones.</p>
<p>"No, nobody's sister&mdash;least of all a sister here&mdash;but the young lady who came
over here from Lenox two months ago&mdash;Bessie Stewart, Mrs. Sloman's niece." (I
knew that Mrs. Sloman was quite familiar with some of the Shakeresses, and
visited them at times.)</p>
<p>Very composedly the sister took a chair and folded her hands across her
outspread handkerchief before she spoke again. I noticed at this moment that her
dress was just the color of her eyes, a pale, stony blue.</p>
<p>"Sister Eliza: it is the same," in measured accents. "She is not here: she
has gone&mdash;to Watervliet."</p>
<p>Can this be treachery? I thought, and is she still in the house? Will they
hide from her that I am here? But there was no fathoming the woman's cold blue
eyes.</p>
<p>"To Watervliet?" I inquired dismally. "How? when? how did she go?"</p>
<p>"She went in one of our wagons: Sister Leah and Brother Ephraim went
along."</p>
<p>"When will they return?"</p>
<p>"I cannot say."</p>
<p>All this time the man was leaning back against the wall, but uttered not a
word. A glance of triumph shot from the sister's eyes as I rose. But she was
mistaken if she thought I was going away. I stepped to the window, and throwing
it open called to Hiram, who was still sitting in his wagon, chewing composedly
a bit of straw. He leaped out in an instant, and leaning out to him I rapidly
repeated in an undertone the previous conversation: "What would you do?"</p>
<p>"Ten chances to one it's a lie. Tell 'em you'll set there till you see her.
They can't shake us off that way."</p>
<p>I drew in my head. The pair still sat as before. "Well," said I, "as I
<i>must</i> see her, and as you seem so uncertain about it, I will wait
here."</p>
<p>And again I took my seat. The sister's face flushed. I had meant no rudeness
in my tone, but she must have detected the suspicion in it. She crimsoned to her
temples, and said hastily, "It is impossible for us to entertain strangers
to-day. A brother is dying in the house: we are all waiting for him to pass away
from moment to moment. We can submit to no intrusion."</p>
<p>Well, perhaps it was an intrusion. It was certainly their house if it did
hold my darling. I looked at her steadily: "Are you sure that Bessie Stewart has
gone away from here?"</p>
<p>"To Watervliet&mdash;yea," she answered composedly. "She left here last week."</p>
<p>My skill at cross-examination was at fault. If that woman was lying, she
would be a premium witness. "I should be sorry, madam," I said, recalling the
world's etiquette, which I had half forgotten, "to intrude upon you at this or
any other time, but I cannot leave here in doubt. Will you oblige me by stating
the exact hour and day at which Miss Stewart is expected to return from
Watervliet, and the road thither?"</p>
<p>She glanced across the room. Answering the look, the man spoke, for the first
time since she had entered: "The party, I believe, will be home to-night."</p>
<p>"And she with them?"</p>
<p>"Yea, unless she has elected to remain."</p>
<p>"At what hour?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell."</p>
<p>"By what road shall I meet her?"</p>
<p>"There are two roads: we generally use the river-road."</p>
<p>"To-night? I will go to meet her. By the river-road, you say?"</p>
<p>"Yea."</p>
<p>"And if I do not meet her?"</p>
<p>"If thou dost not meet her," said the lady-abbess, answering calmly, "it will
be because she is detained on the road."</p>
<p>I had to believe her, and yet I was very skeptical. As I walked out of the
door the man was at my heels. He followed me out on to the wooden stoop and
nodded to Hiram.</p>
<p>"Who is that, Hiram?" I whispered as he leaned across the back of a horse,
adjusting some leathern buckle.</p>
<p>"That?" said Hiram under his breath. "That's a deep 'un: that's Elder
Nebson."</p>
<p>Great was the dissatisfaction of the stout-hearted Splinter at my retreat, as
he called it, from the enemy's ground.</p>
<p>"I'd ha' liked nothin' better than to beat up them quarters. I thought every
minit' you'd be calling me, and was ready to go in." And he clenched his fist in
a way that showed unmistakably how he would have "gone in" had he
been summoned. By this time we were driving on
briskly toward the river-road. "You wa'n't smart, I reckon, to leave that there
house. It was your one chance, hevin' got in. Ten chances to one she's hid away
som'eres in one of them upper rooms," and he pointed to a row of dormer-windows,
"not knowin' nothin' of your bein' there."</p>
<p>"Stop!" I said with one foot on the shafts. "You don't mean to say she is
shut up there?"</p>
<p>"Shet up? No: they be too smart for that. But there's plenty ways to shet a
young gal's eyes an' ears 'thout lockin' of her up. How'd she know who was in
this wagon, even if she seed it from her winders? To be sure, I made myself
conspicuous enough, a-whistlin' 'Tramp, tramp,' and makin' the horses switch
round a good deal. But, like enough, ef she'd be down-spereted-like, she'd never
go near the winder, but just set there, a-stitchin' beads on velvet or
a-plattin' them mats."</p>
<p>"Why should she work?" I asked, with my grasp still on the reins.</p>
<p>"Them all does," he answered, taking a fresh bite of the straw. "It's the
best cure for sorrow, they say. Or mebbe she's a-teachin' the children. I see a
powerful sight of children comin' along while you was in there talkin', a-goin'
to their school, and I tried to ask some o' them about her. But the old sheep
who was drivin' on 'em looked at me like vinegar, and I thought I'd better shet
up, or mebbe she'd give the alarm that we was here with horses and wagon to
carry her off."</p>
<p>I had a painful moment of indecision as Hiram paused in his narrative and
leisurely proceeded to evict a fly from the near horse's ear. "I think we'll go
on, Hiram," I said, jumping back to my seat again. "Take the river-road."</p>
<p>Hiram had brought plentiful provision for his horses in a bag under the seat.
"Victualed for a march or a siege," he said as he dragged out a tin kettle from
the same receptacle when we drew up by the roadside an hour after. "We're clear
of them pryin' Shakers, and we'll just rest a spell."</p>
<p>I could not demur, though my impatience was urging me on faster than his
hungry horses could go.</p>
<p>"I told Susan," he said, "to put me up a bit of pie and cheese&mdash;mebbe we
wouldn't be back afore night. Won't you hev' some?&mdash;there's a plenty."</p>
<p>But I declined the luncheon, and while he munched away contentedly, and while
the horses crunched their corn, I got out and walked on, telling Hiram to follow
at his leisure. My heart beat fast as I espied a wagon in the distance with
one&mdash;yes, two&mdash;Shaker bonnets in it. Bessie in masquerade! Perhaps so&mdash;it could not
be the other: that would be too horrible. But she was coming, surely coming, and
the cold prim sister had told the truth, after all.</p>
<p>The wagon came nearer. In it were two weather-beaten dames, neither of whom
could possibly be mistaken for Bessie in disguise; and the lank, long-haired
brother who was driving them looked ignorant as a child of anything save the
management of his horses. I hailed them, and the wagon drew up at the side of
the road.</p>
<p>It was the women who answered in shrill, piping voices: "Ben to Watervliet?
Nay, they'd ben driving round the country, selling garden seeds."</p>
<p>"Did they know Bessie Stewart, who was staying in the Shaker village, in the
house by the bridge?"</p>
<p>"Sure, there had ben a stranger woman come there some time ago: they could
not tell&mdash;never heerd her name."</p>
<p>I was forced to let them drive on after I had exhausted every possible
inquiry, trusting that Hiram, who was close behind, would have keener wit in
questioning them, but Hiram, as it happened, did not come up to them at all.
They must have turned off into some farm-house lane before they passed him. The
afternoon wore on. It grew toward sunset, and still we kept the river-road.
There was no trace of the Shaker wagon, and indeed the road was growing wild and
lonely.</p>
<p>"I tell you what," said Hiram, stopping suddenly, "these beasts can't go on
for ever, and then turn round and come back
again. I'll turn here, and drive to the little tavern we passed about two mile
back, and stable 'em, and then you and me can watch the road."</p>
<p>It was but reasonable, and I had to assent, though to turn back seemed an
evil omen, and to carry me away from Bessie. The horses were stabled, and I
meanwhile paced the broad open sweep in front of the tavern, across which the
lights were shining. Hiram improved the opportunity to eat a hearty supper,
urging me to partake. But as I declined, in my impatience, to take my eyes off
the road, he brought me out a bowl of some hot fluid and something on a plate,
which I got through with quickly enough, for the cool evening air had sharpened
my appetite. I rested the bowl on the broad bench beside the door, while Hiram
went backward and forward with the supplies.</p>
<p>"Now," said he as I finished at last, still keeping my eye upon the road,
"you go in and take a turn lyin' down: I'll watch the road. I'm a-goin' to see
this thing out."</p>
<p>But I was not ready to sleep yet; so, yielding to my injunction, he went in,
and I seated myself, wrapped in a buffalo robe from the wagon. The night was
damp and chill.</p>
<p>"Hedn't you better set at the window?" said the kind-hearted landlady,
bustling out. Hiram had evidently told her the story.</p>
<p>"Oh no, thank you;" for I was impatient of walls and tongues, and wanted to
be alone with my anxiety.</p>
<p>What madness was this in Bessie? She could not, oh she could not, have thrown
her life away! What grief and disquiet must have driven her into this refuge!
Poor little soul, scorched and racked by distrust and doubt! if she could not
trust me, whom should she trust?</p>
<p>The household noises ceased one by one; the clump of willows by the river
grew darker and darker; the stars came out and shone with that magnetic
brilliancy that fixes our gaze upon them, leading one to speculate on their
influence, and&mdash;</p>
<p>A hand on my shoulder: Hiram with a lantern turned full upon my face. "'Most
one o'clock," he said, rubbing his eyes sleepily. "Come to take my turn. Have
you seen nothing?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," I said, staggering to my feet, which felt like lead&mdash;"nothing."</p>
<p>I did not confess it, but to this hour I cannot tell whether I had been
nodding for one minute or ten. I kept my own counsel as I turned over the watch
to Hiram, but a suspicion shot through me that perhaps that wagon had gone by,
after all, in the moment that I had been off guard.</p>
<p>Hiram kept the watch faithfully till five that morning, when I too was
stirring. One or two teams had passed, but no Shaker wagon rattling through the
night. We breakfasted in the little room that overlooked the road. Outside, at
the pump, a lounging hostler, who had been bribed to keep a sharp lookout for a
Shaker wagon, whistled and waited too.</p>
<p>"Tell you what," said Hiram, bolting a goodly rouleau of ham and eggs, "I've
got an idee. You and me might shilly-shally here on this road all day, and what
surety shall we hev' that they hevn't gone by the other road. Old gal said there
was two?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but the folks here say that the other is a wild mountain-road, and not
much used."</p>
<p>"Well, you see they comes down by the boat a piece, or they <i>may</i> cut
across the river at Greenbush. They have queer ways. Now, mebbe they <i>have</i>
come over that mountain-road in the night, while you and me was a-watchin' this
like ferrits. In that case she's safe and sound at Shaker Village, not knowin'
anything of your coming; and Elder Nebson and that other is laughin' in their
sleeves at us."</p>
<p>"Perhaps so."</p>
<p>"Now, this is my advice, but I'll do just as you say. 'Tain't no good to lay
around and watch that ere house <i>to day</i>. Ef we hedn't been in such a white
heat, we might just hev' hid round in the neighborhood <i>there</i> till she
came along. But it's too late, for that now. Let's you
and me lay low till Sunday. She'll be sure to go to meetin' on
Sunday ef she's there, and you can quietly slip in and see if she is. And to
shut their eyes up, so that they won't suspect nothin', we'll leave a message on
one of your pasteboards that you're very sorry not to hev' seen her, drefful
sorry, but that you can't wait no longer, and you are off. They'll think you're
off for York: you've got York on your cards, hevn't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You just come and stay to my house: we'll make you comfortable, and there's
only one day longer to wait. This is Friday, be'ent it? You'd best not be seen
around to the hotel, lest any of their spies be about. They do a powerful sight
o' drivin' round the country this time o' year. And then, you see, ef on Sunday
she isn't there, you can go over to Watervliet, or we'll search them
houses&mdash;whichever you choose."</p>
<p>There seemed no help for it but to take Hiram's advice. We drove homeward
through the Shaker village, and drew up at the house again. This time the door
was opened by a bent, sharp little Creole, as I took her to be: the beaming
portress of the day before had been relieved at her post.</p>
<p>"Nay, Bessie Stewart was not at home: she would go and inquire for me when
she was expected."</p>
<p>"No," I said carelessly, not wishing to repeat the scene of yesterday and to
present myself, a humiliated failure, before the two elders again&mdash;"no: give her
this card when she does come, and tell her I could stay no longer."</p>
<p>I had not written any message on the card, for the message, indeed, was not
for Bessie, but for the others. She would interpret it that I was in the
neighborhood, anxious and waiting: she would understand.</p>
<p>"Home, then, Hiram," as I took my seat beside him. "We'll wait till
Sunday."</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p>"You'd better eat sum'thin'," said Hiram over the breakfast-table on Sunday
morning. "Got a good long drive afore you, and mebbe a good day's work besides.
No? Well, then, Susan, you put the apple-brandy into the basket, and some of
them rusks, for I reckon we'll hev' work with this young man afore night."</p>
<p>Susan, bless her good heart! wanted to go along, and as Hiram's excitement
was evidently at the highest pitch, he consented that she should occupy the back
seat of the wagon: "P'raps Miss Stewart'll feel more comfortable about leavin'
when she sees there's a woman along."</p>
<p>It was a rainy morning, and there were but few wagons on the road. Arrived at
the village, we encountered one little procession after another of broad-brim
straws and Shaker bonnets turning out of the several houses as we drove past.
They stepped along quickly, and seemed to take no notice of us.</p>
<p>"Reckon we're the only visitors to-day," whispered Hiram as he stopped at the
horseblock in front of the meeting-house. "You know where you hev' to set&mdash;on the
left-hand side; and Susan, she goes to the right."</p>
<p>I followed Susan up the steps, and she hastened, as ordered, to the right,
while I took my seat on one of the back benches of the left, against the wall.
It was a barn-like structure, large, neat and exquisitely chill. Two large
stoves on either side possibly had fire in them&mdash;an old man who looked like an
ancient porter went to them from time to time and put on coal&mdash;but the very walls
reflected a chill, blue glare. The roof was lofty and vaulted, and added to the
hollow coldness of the hall. The whole apartment was clean to sanctity, and in
its straitness and blank dreariness no unfit emblem of the faith it
embodied.</p>
<p>Around three sides of the hall, and facing the benches for visitors, the
Shaker fraternity were ranged. The hats and straight straw bonnets hung
decorously upon the wall over their heads: here and there a sky-blue shawl or
one of faded lilac hung beneath the headgear. Across the wide apartment it was
difficult to distinguish faces. I scanned
closely the sisterhood&mdash;old, withered faces most of them, with here and there one
young and blooming&mdash;but no Bessie as yet. Still, they were coming in continually
through the side door: she might yet appear. I recognized my lady-abbess, who
sat directly facing me, in a seat of state apparently, and close to her, on the
brethren's side of the house, was Elder Nebson.</p>
<p>The services began. All rose, and sisters and brethren faced each other and
sang a hymn, with no accompaniment and no melody&mdash;a harsh chant in wild, barbaric
measure. Then, after a prayer, they entered upon the peculiar method of their
service. Round and round the room they trooped in two large circles, sister
following sister, brother brother, keeping time with their hanging hands to the
rhythm of the hymn. Clustered in the centre was a little knot of men and women,
the high dignitaries, who seemed to lead the singing with their clapping
hands.</p>
<p>The circles passed each other and wove in and out, each preserving its
unbroken continuity. I looked for Elder Nebson: could it be that he was joining
in these gyrations? Yes, he was leading one of the lines. But I noticed that his
hands moved mechanically, not with the spasmodic fervor of the rest, and that
his eyes, instead of the dull, heavy stare of his fellows, sought with faithful
yet shy constancy the women's ranks. And as the women filed past me, wringing
their hands, I scrutinized each face and figure&mdash;the sweet-faced portress, the
shrunken little creole ("A mulatto, she is," Hiram whispered&mdash;he had taken his
seat beside me&mdash;"and very powerful, they say, among 'em"), and some fair young
girls; two or three of these with blooming cheeks bursting frankly through the
stiff bordering of their caps. But I saw not the face I sought.</p>
<p>"Them children! Ain't it awful?" muttered Hiram as a file of blue-coat boys
shambled past, with hair cut square across their foreheads and bleached white
with the sun. "Ain't got a grain of sense! Look at 'em!&mdash;all crowded clean out by
the Shaker schools."</p>
<p>And surely they were a most unpromising little crowd. Waifs, snatched
probably from some New York whirlpool of iniquity, and wearing the brute mark on
their faces, which nothing in this school of their transplanting tended to
erase&mdash;a sodden little party, like stupid young beasts of burden, uncouth and
awkward.</p>
<p>As the girls came round again, and I had settled it in my mind that there was
certainly no Bessie in the room, I could watch them more calmly. Eagerly as I
sought her face, it was a relief, surely, that it was not there. Pale to
ghastliness, most of them, with high, sharpened shoulders, and features set like
those of a corpse, it was indeed difficult to realize that these ascetic forms,
these swaying devotees, were women&mdash;women who might else have been wives and
mothers. Some of them wore in their hollow eyes an expression of ecstasy akin to
madness, and there was not a face there that was not saintly pure.</p>
<p>It was a strange union that assembled under one roof these nun-like
creatures, wasted and worn with their rigid lives, and the heavy, brutish men,
who shambled round the room like plough-horses. <i>Wicked</i> eyes some of them
had, mere slits through which a cunning and selfish spirit looked out. Some
faces there were of power, but in them the disagreeable traits were even more
strongly marked: the ignorant, narrow foreheads were better, less responsible,
it seemed.</p>
<p>The singing ended, there was a sermon from a high priest who stood out
imperious among his fellows. But this was not a sermon to the flock. It was
aimed at the scanty audience of strangers with words of unblushing directness.
How men and women may continue pure in the constant hearing and repetition of
such revolting arguments and articles of faith is matter of serious question.
The divine instincts of maternity, the sweet attractions of human love, were
thrown down and stamped under foot in the mud of this man's mind; and at each
peroration, exhorting his hearers to shake off Satan, a strong convulsive shiver
ran through the assembly.</p>
<p>"Bessie is certainly not here: possibly
she's still at Watervliet," I whispered to; Hiram
as the concluding hymn began. "But I'll have a chance at Elder Nebson and that
woman before they leave; the house."</p>
<p>The rain had ceased for some time, and as again the wild chant went up from
those harsh strained voices, a stray sunbeam, like a gleam of good promise, shot
across the floor. But what was this little figure stealing in through a
side-door and joining the circling throng?&mdash;a figure in lilac gown, with the
stiff muslin cap and folded neckerchief. She entered at the farthest corner of
the room, and I watched her approach with beating heart. Something in the easy
step was familiar, and yet it could not be. She passed around with the rest in
the inner circle, and, leaning forward, I held my breath lest indeed it might be
she.</p>
<p>The circle opened, and again the long line of march around the room. The
lilac figure came nearer and nearer, and now I see her face. It is Bessie!</p>
<p>With a cry I sprang up, but with a blow, a crash, a horrible darkness swept
over me like a wave, and I knew nothing.</p>
<p>When I came to myself I was lying on a bed in a room that was new to me. A
strong light, as of the setting sun, shone upon the whitewashed wall. There was
a little table, over which hung a looking-glass, surmounted by two fans of
turkey feathers. I stared feebly at the fans for a while, and then closed my
eyes again.</p>
<p>Where was I? I had a faint remembrance of jolting in a wagon, and of pitying
faces bent over me, but where was I now? Again I opened my eyes, and noted the
gay patchwork covering of the bed, and the green paper curtain of the window in
the golden wall&mdash;green, with a tall yellow flower-pot on it, with sprawling roses
of blue and red. Turning with an effort toward the side whence all the
brightness came, in a moment two warm arms were round my neck, and a face that I
could not see was pressed close to mine.</p>
<p>"Oh, Charlie, Charlie! forgive, forgive me for being so bad!"</p>
<p>"Bessie," I answered dreamingly, and seemed to be drifting away again. But a
strong odor of pungent salts made my head tingle again, and when I could open my
eyes for the tears they rested on my darling's face&mdash;my own darling in a soft
white dress, kneeling by my bedside, with both her arms round me. A vigorous
patting of the pillow behind me revealed Mrs. Splinter, tearful too: "He's come
to now. Don't bother him with talk, Miss Bessie. I'll fetch the tea."</p>
<p>And with motherly insistance she brought me a steaming bowl of beef-tea,
while I still lay, holding Bessie's hand, with a feeble dawning that the vision
was real.</p>
<p>"No," she said as Bessie put out her arm for the bowl, "you prop up his head.
I've got a steddyer hand: you'd just spill it all over his go-to-meetin'
suit."</p>
<p>I looked down at myself. I was still dressed in the clothes that I had
worn&mdash;when was it? last week?&mdash;when I had started for the Shaker meeting.</p>
<p>"How long?" I said feebly.</p>
<p>"Only this morning, you darling boy, it all happened; and here we are, snug
at Mrs. Splinter's, and Mary Jane is getting the cottage ready for us as fast as
ever she can."</p>
<p>How good that beef-tea was! Bessie knew well what would give it the <i>sauce
piquante</i>. "Ready for us!"</p>
<p>"Here's the doctor at last," said Hiram, putting his head in at the door.
"Why, hillo! are we awake?"</p>
<p>"The doctor! Dr. Wilder?" I said beamingly. How good of Bessie! how
thoughtful!</p>
<p>"Not Dr. Wilder, you dear old boy!" said Bessie, laughing and blushing,
"though I sha'n't scold you, Charlie, for that!" in a whisper in my ear. "It's
Dr. Bolster of Lee. Hiram has been riding all over the country for him this
afternoon."</p>
<p>"I'll go down to him," I said, preparing to rise.</p>
<p>"No you won't;" and Mrs. Splinter's strong arm, as well as Bessie's soft
hand, patted me down again.</p>
<p>Dr. Bolster pronounced, as well he might, that all danger was over. The
blow on my head&mdash;I must have struck it with force
against the projecting window-shelf as I sprang up&mdash;was enough to have stunned
me; but the doctor, I found, was inclined to theorize: "A sudden vertigo, a
dizziness: the Shaker hymns and dances have that effect sometimes upon persons
viewing them for the first time. Or perhaps the heat of the room." He calmly
fingered my pulse for a few seconds, with his fat ticking watch in his other
hand, and then retired to the bureau to write a prescription, which I was
indignantly prepared to repudiate. But Bessie, in a delightful little pantomime,
made signs to me to be patient: we could throw it all out of the window
afterward if need be.</p>
<p>"A soothing draught, and let him keep quiet for a day or so, will be all that
is required. I will call to-morrow if you would prefer it."</p>
<p>"We will send you a note, doctor, to-morrow morning: he seems so much
stronger already that perhaps it will not be necessary to make you take such a
long drive."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I'm very busy. You send me word whether to come or not."</p>
<p>And bustlingly the good doctor departed, with Mrs. Splinter majestically
descending to hold whispered conference with him at the gate.</p>
<p>"Charlie, I <i>will</i> send for Dr. Wilder if you are ready, for I'm never
going to leave you another minute as long as we live."</p>
<p>"I think," said I, laughing, "that I should like to stand up first on my
feet; that is, if I have any feet."</p>
<p>What a wonderful prop and support was Bessie! How skillfully she helped me to
step once, twice, across the floor! and when I sank down, very tired, in the
comfortable easy-chair by the window, she knelt on the floor beside me and
bathed my forehead with fragrant cologne, that certainly did not come from Mrs.
Splinter's tall bottle of lavender compound on the bureau.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear boy, I have <i>so</i> much to say! Where shall I begin?"</p>
<p>"At the end," I said quietly. "Send for Dr. Wilder."</p>
<p>"But don't you want to hear what a naughty girl&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I want to hear nothing but 'I, Elizabeth, take thee&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"But I've been so very jealous, so suspicious and angry. <i>Don't</i> you
want to hear how bad I am?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, closing the discussion after an old fashion of the Sloman
cottage, "not until we two walk together to the Ledge to-morrow, my little wife
and I."</p>
<p>"Where's a card&mdash;your card, Charlie? It would be more proper-like, as Mrs.
Splinter would say, for you to write it."</p>
<p>"I will try," I said, taking out a card-case from my breast-pocket. As I drew
it forth my hand touched a package, Fanny Meyrick's packet. Shall I give it to
her now? I hesitated. No, we'll be married first in the calm faith that each has
in the other to-day, needing no outward assurance or written word.</p>
<p>I penciled feebly, with a very shaky hand, my request that the doctor would
call at Hiram Splinter's, at his earliest convenience that evening, to perform
the ceremony of marriage between his young friend, Bessie Stewart, and the
subscriber. Hiram's eldest son, a youth of eight, was swinging on the gate under
our window. To him Bessie entrusted the card, with many injunctions to give it
into no other hands than the doctor's own.</p>
<p>In less time than we had anticipated, as we looked out of the window at the
last pink glow of the sunset, the urchin reappeared, walking with great strides
beside a spare little-figure, whom we recognized as the worthy doctor
himself.</p>
<p>"Good gracious! he <i>is</i> in a hurry!" said Bessie, retiring hastily from
the window; "and we have not said a word to Mrs. Splinter yet!"</p>
<p>We had expected the little doctor would wait below until the bridal-party
should descend; but no, he came directly up stairs, and walked into the room
without prelude. He took Bessie in his arms with fatherly tenderness: "Ah, you
runaway! so you've come back at last?"</p>
<p>"Yes, doctor, and don't you let go of her until you have married her fast to
me."</p>
<p>"Ahem!" said the doctor, clearing his throat, "that is just what I came to
advise you about. Hiram told me this afternoon of the chase you two had had, and
of your illness this morning. Now, as it is half over the village by this time
that Bessie Stewart has been rescued from the Shaker village by a chivalrous
young gentleman, and as everybody is wild with impatience to know the
<i>dénoûment</i>, I want you to come down quietly to the church this evening and
be married after evening service."</p>
<p>"To please everybody?" I said, in no very pleasant humor.</p>
<p>"I think it will be wisest, best; and I am sure this discreetest of women,"
still holding Bessie's hand, "will agree with me. You need not sit through the
service. Hiram can bring you down after it has begun; and you may sit in the
vestry till the clerk calls you. I'll preach a short sermon to-night," with a
benignant chuckle.</p>
<p>He had his will. Some feeling that it would please Mrs. Sloman best, the only
person besides ourselves whom it concerned us to please, settled it in Bessie's
mind, although she anxiously inquired several times before the doctor left if I
felt equal to going to church. Suppose I should faint on the way?</p>
<p>I was equal to it, for I took a long nap on the sofa in Mrs. Splinter's
parlor through the soft spring twilight, while Bessie held what seemed to me
interminable conferences with Mary Jane.</p>
<p>It was not a brilliant ceremony so far as the groom was concerned. As we
stood at the chancel-rail I am afraid that the congregation, largely augmented,
by this time, by late-comers&mdash;for the doctor had spread the news through the
village far and wide&mdash;thought me but a very pale and quiet bridegroom.</p>
<p>But the bride's beauty made amends for all. Just the same soft white dress of
the afternoon&mdash;or was it one like it?&mdash;with no ornaments, no bridal veil. I have
always pitied men who have to plight their troth to a moving mass of lace and
tulle, weighed down with orange-blossoms massive as lead. This was my own little
wife as she would walk by my side through life, dressed as she might be the next
day and always.</p>
<p>But the next day it was the tartan cloak that she wore, by special request,
as we climbed the hill to the Ledge. It was spring indeed&mdash;bluebirds in the air,
and all the sky shone clear and warm.</p>
<p>"Let <i>me</i> begin," said my wife as she took her old seat under the
sheltering pine. "You can't have anything to say, Charlie, in comparison with
me."</p>
<p>There was a short preliminary pause, and then she began.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p>"Well, after you wouldn't take me to Europe, you know&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You naughty girl!"</p>
<p>"No interruptions, sir. After you <i>couldn't</i> take me to Europe I felt
very much hurt and wounded, and ready to catch at any straw of suspicion. I ran
away from you that night and left you in the parlor, hoping that you would call
me back, and yet longing to hide myself from you too. You understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, let us not dwell on that."</p>
<p>"Well, I believe I never thought once of Fanny Meyrick's going to Europe too
until she joined us on the road that day&mdash;you remember?&mdash;at the washerwoman's
gate."</p>
<p>"Yes; and do <i>you</i> remember how Fidget and I barked at her with all our
hearts?"</p>
<p>"I was piqued then at the air of ownership Fanny seemed to assume in you. She
had just come to Lenox, I knew; she could know nothing of our intimacy, our
relations; and this seemed like the renewal of something old&mdash;something that had
been going on before. Had she any claim on you? I wondered. And then, too, you
were so provokingly reticent about her whenever her name had been mentioned
before."</p>
<p>"Was I? What a fool I was! But, Bessie dear, I could not say to even you,
then, that I believed Fanny Meyrick was in&mdash;cared a great deal for me."</p>
<p>"I understand," said Bessie nodding. "We'll skip that, and take it for
granted. But you see <i>I</i> couldn't take
anything for granted but just what I saw that day; and the little
memorandum-book and Fanny's reminiscences nearly killed me. I don't know how I
sat through it all. I tried to avoid you all the rest of the day. I wanted to
think, and to find out the truth from Fanny."</p>
<p>"I should think you <i>did</i> avoid me pretty successfully, leaving me to
dine coldly at the hotel, and then driving all the afternoon till
train-time."</p>
<p>"It was in talking to Fanny that afternoon that I discovered how she felt
toward you. She has no concealment about her, not any, and I could read her
heart plainly enough. But then she hinted at her father's treatment of you;
thought he had discouraged you, rebuffed you, and reasoned so that I fairly
thought there might be truth in it, <i>remembering it was before you knew
me."</i></p>
<p>"Listen one minute, Bessie, till I explain that. It's my belief, and always
was, that that shrewd old fellow, Henry Meyrick, saw very clearly how matters
were all along&mdash;saw how the impetuous Miss Fanny was&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>Falling in love</i>: don't pause for a 'more tenderer word,' Charlie. Sam
Weller couldn't find any."</p>
<p>"Well, falling in love, if you <i>will</i> say it&mdash;and that it was decidedly a
difficult situation for me. I remember so well that night on the piazza, when
Fanny clung about me like a mermaid, he bade her sharply go and change her
dripping garments, and what Fanny calls 'a decidedly queer' expression came into
his face. He could not say anything, poor old chap! and he always behaved with
great courtesy to me. I am sure he divined that I was a most unimpassioned actor
in that high-comedy plunge into the Hudson."</p>
<p>"Very well: I believe it, I'm sure, but, you see, how could I know then what
was or was not true? Then it was that I resolved to give you leave&mdash;or rather
give her leave to try. I had written my note in the morning, saying <i>no</i>
finally to the Europe plan, and I scrawled across it, in lead-pencil, while
Fanny stood at her horse's head, those ugly words, you remember?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said: "'Go to Europe with Fanny Meyrick, and come up to Lenox, both
of you, when you return.'"</p>
<p>"Then, after that, my one idea was to get away from Lenox. The place was
hateful to me, and you were writing those pathetic letters about being married,
and state-rooms, and all. It only made me more wretched, for I thought you were
the more urgent now that you had been lacking before. I hurried aunt off to
Philadelphia, and in New York she hurried me. She would not wait, though I did
want to, and I was so disappointed at the hotel! But I thought there was a fate
in it to give Fanny Meyrick her chance, poor thing! and so I wrote that good-bye
note without an address."</p>
<p>"But I found you, for all, thanks to Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>
<p>"Yes, and when you came that night I was so happy. I put away all fear: I had
to remind myself, actually, all the time, of what I owed to Fanny, until you
told me you had changed your passage to the Algeria, and that gave me strength
to be angry. Oh, my dear, I'm afraid you'll have a very bad wife. Of course the
minute you had sailed I began to be horribly jealous, and then I got a letter by
the pilot that made me worse."</p>
<p>"But," said I, "you got my letters from the other side. Didn't that assure
you that you might have faith in me?"</p>
<p>"But I would not receive them. Aunt Sloman has them all, done up and labeled
for you, doubtless. She, it seems&mdash;had you talked her over?&mdash;thought I ought to
have gone with you, and fretted because she was keeping me. Then I couldn't bear
it another day. It was just after you had sailed, and I had cut out the
ship-list to send you; and I had worked myself up to believe you would go back
to Fanny Meyrick if you had the chance. I told Aunt Sloman that it was all over
between us&mdash;that you might continue to write to me, but I begged that she would
keep all your letters in a box until I should ask her for them."</p>
<p>"But I wrote letters to her, too, asking what had become of you."</p>
<p>"She went to Minnesota, you know, early in February."</p>
<p>"And why didn't you go with her?"</p>
<p>"She scolded me dreadfully because I would not. But she was so well, and she
had her maid and a pleasant party of Philadelphia friends; and I&mdash;well, I didn't
want to put all those hundreds of miles between me and the sea."</p>
<p>"And was Shaker Village so near, then, to the sea?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Charlie," hiding her face on my shoulder, "that was cowardice in me. You
know I meant to keep the cottage open and live there. It was the saddest place
in all the world, but still I wanted to be there&mdash;alone. But I found I could not
be alone; and the last people who came drove me nearly wild&mdash;those R&mdash;&mdash;s, Fanny
Meyrick's friends&mdash;and they talked about her and about you, so that I could bear
it no longer. I wanted to hide myself from all the world. I knew I could be
quiet at the Shaker village. I had often driven over there with Aunt Sloman:
indeed, Sophia&mdash;that's the one you saw&mdash;is a great friend of Aunt Maria's."</p>
<p>"So the lady-abbess confessed, did she?" I asked with some curiosity.</p>
<p>"Yes: she said you were rudely inquisitive; but she excused you as unfamiliar
with Shaker ways."</p>
<p>"And were you really at Watervliet?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but don't be in a hurry: we'll come to that presently. Sophia gave me a
pretty little room opening out of hers, and they all treated me with great
kindness, if they <i>did</i> call me Eliza."</p>
<p>"And did you," I asked with some impatience, remembering Hiram's
description&mdash;"did you sew beads on velvet and plait straw for mats?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I did whatever I pleased. I was parlor-boarder, as they say in the
schools. But I did learn something, sir, from that dear old sister Martha. You
saw <i>her</i>?"</p>
<p>"The motherly body who invited me in?"</p>
<p>"Yes: isn't she a dear? I took lessons from her in all sorts of cookery: you
shall see, Charlie, I've profited by being a Shakeress."</p>
<p>"Yes, my darling, but did you&mdash;you didn't go to church?"</p>
<p>"Only once," she said, with a shiver that made her all the dearer, "and they
preached such dreary stuff that I told Sophia I would never go again."</p>
<p>"But did you really wear that dress I saw you in?"</p>
<p>"For that once only. You see, I was at Watervliet when you came. If you had
only gone straight there, dear goose! instead of dodging in the road, you would
have found me. I had grown a little tired of the monotony of the village, and
was glad to join the party starting for Niskayuna, it was such a glorious drive
across the mountain. I longed for you all the time."</p>
<p>"Pretty little Shakeress! But why did they put us on such a false track?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we had expected to reach home that night, but one of the horses was
lame, and we did not start as soon as we had planned. We came back on Saturday
afternoon&mdash;Saturday afternoon, and this is Monday morning!", leaning back
dreamily, and looking across the blue distance to the far-off hills. "Then I got
your card, and they told me about you, and I knew, for all the message, that
you'd be back on Sunday morning. But how could I tell then that Fanny Meyrick
would not be with you?"</p>
<p>"Bessie!" and my hand tightened on hers.</p>
<p>"Oh, Charlie, you don't know what it is to be jealous. Of course I did know
that&mdash;no, I didn't, either, though I must have been <i>sure</i> underneath that
day. For it was more in fun than anything else, after I knew you were in the
meeting-house&mdash;"</p>
<p>"How did you know?"</p>
<p>"I saw you drive up&mdash;you and Hiram and Mrs. Hiram."</p>
<p>"You didn't think, then, that it was Mrs. Charles?"</p>
<p>"So I stole into Sophia's room, and put on one of her dresses. She is tall
too, but it did not fit very well."</p>
<p>"I should think not," I answered, looking down admiringly at her.</p>
<p>"In fact," laughing, "I took quite a time
pinning myself into it and getting the neckerchief folded prim. I waited till
after the sermon, and then I knew by the singing that it was the last hymn, so I
darted in. I don't know what they thought&mdash;that I was suddenly converted, I
suppose, and they would probably have given thanks over me as a brand snatched
from the burning. Did I do the dance well? I didn't want to put them out."</p>
<p>"My darling, it was a dreadful masquerade. Did you want to punish me to the
end?"</p>
<p>"I was punished myself, Charlie, when you fell. Oh dear! don't let's talk
about the dreadful thing any more. But I think you would have forgiven Elder
Nebson if you had seen how tenderly he lifted you into the wagon. There, now:
where are we going to live in New York, and what have we got to live on besides
my little income?"</p>
<p>"Income! I had forgotten you had any."</p>
<p>"Ask Judge Hubbard if I haven't. You'll see."</p>
<p>"But, my dear," said I gravely, drawing forth the packet from my breast, "I,
too, have my story to tell. I cannot call it a confession, either; rather it is
the story of somebody else&mdash;Hallo! who's broken the seal?" For on shipboard I had
beguiled the time by writing a sort of journal to accompany Fanny's letter, and
had placed all together in a thick white envelope, addressing it, in legal
parlance, "To whom it may concern."</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> did," said Bessie faintly, burying her face on my arm. "It fell out
of your pocket when they carried you up stairs; and I read it, every word, twice
over, before you came to yourself."</p>
<p>"You little witch! And I thought you were marrying me out of pure faith in
me, and not of sight or knowledge."</p>
<p>"It was faith, the highest faith," said Bessie proudly, and looking into my
eyes with her old saucy dash, "to know, to feel sure, that that sealed paper
concerned nobody but me."</p>
<p>And so she has ever since maintained.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
